We completed comprehensive analysis using ultrathink to determine if work should be kept or rebuilt from scratch.\n\n## TeachFlow Module Overview\n\n**Purpose**: Comprehensive teaching workflow system for classroom instruction, behavior management, professional responsibilities, and data analysis\n\n**Module Code**: `teachflow`\n**Location**: `/home/sallvain/dev/personal/BMAD-Education-Module/bmad/teachflow/`\n\n**Designed Components**:\n- **8 Agents**: 4 core (instructional-designer, behavior-specialist, professional-writer, data-analyst) + 4 supporting (resource-curator, accommodation-specialist, report-generator, goal-tracker)\n- **9 Workflows**: lesson-plan-builder, behavior-incident-report, progress-report-generator, unit-planning, assessment-creation, differentiation-strategies, student-goal-setting, classroom-management-plans, parent-communication-templates\n- **Delegation Model**: Core agents can delegate to supporting agents\n\n## Current State Analysis (Ultrathink Complete - 12 Steps)\n\n### What EXISTS and is GOOD ✅\n\n1. **`/bmad/teachflow/README.md`** - Excellent quality (90/100)\n   - Comprehensive overview\n   - Clear module structure\n   - Agent roster with roles\n   - Workflow descriptions\n   - Quick start guide\n   - Best practices\n   - Essentially a lightweight module brief in informal format\n\n2. **`/bmad/teachflow/TODO.md`** - Good roadmap\n   - 4 phased development approach\n   - Priority rankings (🔴 Critical, 🟡 Important, 🟢 Enhancement)\n   - Time estimates per component\n   - Testing checklist\n   - Realistic progression\n\n3. **`/bmad/teachflow/config.yaml`** - Proper BMAD structure ✅\n   - Module metadata correct\n   - Component counts defined\n   - Delegation rules properly specified\n   - Output/data/template paths configured\n   - Follows BMAD standards\n\n4. **`/bmad/teachflow/agents/README.md`** - Good overview documentation\n\n5. **`/bmad/teachflow/workflows/README.md`** - Good overview documentation\n\n### What EXISTS but is BROKEN ⚠️\n\n**`/bmad/teachflow/agents/instructional-designer.agent.yaml`**\n- Partially implemented (persona, identity, communication style are excellent)\n- **CRITICAL ISSUE**: Menu items reference 4 workflows that DON'T exist yet:\n  - `lesson-plan-builder/workflow.yaml` (line 37)\n  - `assessment-creation/workflow.yaml` (line 42)\n  - `differentiation-strategies/workflow.yaml` (line 46)\n  - `student-goal-setting/workflow.yaml` (line 50)\n- **Impact**: Agent will FAIL on load when users try commands\n- **Fix Required**: Comment out workflow references until workflows are created\n\n### What is MISSING ❌\n\n**Agents**: 7 of 8 agents not created (0%)\n- behavior-specialist\n- professional-writer\n- data-analyst\n- resource-curator\n- accommodation-specialist\n- report-generator\n- goal-tracker\n\n**Workflows**: All 9 workflows missing (0%)\n- lesson-plan-builder\n- behavior-incident-report\n- progress-report-generator\n- unit-planning\n- assessment-creation\n- differentiation-strategies\n- student-goal-setting\n- classroom-management-plans\n- parent-communication-templates\n\n**Infrastructure**:\n- `/templates` folder (referenced in config but doesn't exist)\n- `/data` folder (referenced in config but doesn't exist)\n- `/tasks` folder exists but empty (config says count: 0, which is correct)\n\n**Documentation Gaps** (would be filled by proper module brief):\n- ❌ Formal personality theme for agents (implicit but not explicit)\n- ❌ Unique value proposition statement\n- ❌ Detailed user journey scenarios\n- ❌ Success metrics and quality standards\n- ❌ Performance targets\n- ❌ Risk assessment (technical, usability, scope risks)\n- ❌ Mitigation strategies\n- ❌ Creative features/easter eggs\n- ❌ Module lore and theming\n- ❌ Timeline estimates with deliverables\n- ❌ MVP definition\n\n## Completion Assessment\n\n**Overall Module Completion: 15%**\n- Documentation Quality: 90/100 (excellent)\n- Implementation: 5/100 (1 broken agent, 0 workflows)\n- Standards Compliance: 60/100 (good structure, missing formal brief)\n\n## Analysis Conclusion\n\n**VERDICT: SALVAGE & FIX** ✅ (DO NOT rebuild from scratch)\n\n**Rationale**:\n1. Strategic planning is solid and well-thought-out\n2. Documentation quality is high (README is essentially informal brief)\n3. Structure follows BMAD patterns correctly\n4. config.yaml is properly formed\n5. Delegation model is well-designed\n6. Time savings: ~2 hours vs rebuild + preservation of quality thinking\n\n**Compared Against BMAD Standards**:\n- ✅ Module structure matches BMM and CIS examples\n- ✅ Agent/workflow separation correct\n- ✅ Config.yaml follows conventions\n- ❌ Missing formal module brief (critical gap)\n- ❌ Skipped proper workflow sequence\n\n**Proper BMAD Sequence** (from create-module README):\n```\n1. module-brief (optional but recommended)\n2. create-module (uses brief via --input flag)\n3. create-agent (for each agent)\n4. create-workflow (for each workflow)\n```\n\n**What TeachFlow Did**:\n1. ❌ Skipped module-brief\n2. ⚠️ Manually created structure (instead of create-module)\n3. ⚠️ Partially created 1 agent manually (instead of create-agent workflow)\n4. ❌ No workflows created\n\n## Recommended Action Plan\n\n### Immediate Action (NOW - Phase 1)\n1. ✅ **Execute module-brief workflow** using existing TeachFlow docs as input\n   - Use Express Mode (user has solid docs already)\n   - Output: `/home/sallvain/dev/personal/BMAD-Education-Module/docs/module-brief-teachflow-2025-10-14.md`\n   - Fills gaps: risks, metrics, user journeys, personality theme, creative features\n   - Validates strategic decisions against BMAD standards\n   - Creates formal documentation for reference\n\n2. **Fix broken agent** after brief is complete\n   - Edit `/bmad/teachflow/agents/instructional-designer.agent.yaml`\n   - Comment out ALL menu items that reference workflow paths (currently: plan, assess, differentiate, goals)\n   - These reference non-existent workflows: lesson-plan-builder, assessment-creation, differentiation-strategies, student-goal-setting\n   - Add note: \"Workflows pending creation - Phase 2\"\n   - Keep \"help\" and \"exit\" menu items (these don't require workflows)\n\n### Short-term Actions (THIS WEEK - Phase 2)\n3. Create 7 remaining agents using `/bmad:bmb:workflows:create-agent`\n4. Create all 9 workflows using `/bmad:bmb:workflows:create-workflow`\n5. Create `/templates` and `/data` folder structures\n6. Re-enable instructional-designer workflow menu items\n\n### Validation Actions (Phase 3)\n7. Test agent delegation patterns\n8. Run example user journeys from brief\n9. Verify against success criteria\n\n## Module Brief Workflow Execution Details\n\n**Workflow Path**: `/home/sallvain/dev/personal/BMAD-Education-Module/bmad/bmb/workflows/module-brief/`\n\n**Key Files**:\n- `workflow.yaml` - Configuration\n- `instructions.md` - 12-step interactive workflow\n- `template.md` - Output template\n- `checklist.md` - Validation checklist\n\n**Variables Already Resolved**:\n- `user_name`: Frank\n- `communication_language`: English\n- `output_folder`: `/home/sallvain/dev/personal/BMAD-Education-Module/docs`\n- `date`: 2025-10-14\n- `module_code`: teachflow\n- `module_name`: TeachFlow\n\n**Input Sources for Brief Generation**:\n- `/bmad/teachflow/README.md` - Primary source (comprehensive)\n- `/bmad/teachflow/TODO.md` - Development roadmap\n- `/bmad/teachflow/config.yaml` - Technical specifications\n- `/bmad/teachflow/agents/instructional-designer.agent.yaml` - Example persona/style\n\n**Mode Selection**: Express Mode recommended (user has solid existing documentation)\n\n## Template Sections to Fill\n\nBased on `/bmad/bmb/workflows/module-brief/template.md`, need to populate:\n\n1. **Executive Summary** ← Extract from README overview\n2. **Module Identity** ← Define personality theme, unique value prop\n3. **Agent Architecture** ← Use config.yaml + README agent descriptions\n4. **Workflow Ecosystem** ← Use config.yaml workflows list + README descriptions\n5. **User Scenarios** ← CREATE NEW (gap identified)\n6. **Technical Planning** ← Use config.yaml paths + delegation rules\n7. **Success Metrics** ← CREATE NEW (gap identified)\n8. **Development Roadmap** ← Use TODO.md phases\n9. **Creative Features** ← CREATE NEW (gap identified, can be optional)\n10. **Risk Assessment** ← CREATE NEW (gap identified)\n11. **Implementation Notes** ← Extract from TODO.md priority order\n12. **Resources and References** ← Teaching domain resources\n13. **Appendices** ← Detailed specs from config.yaml\n\n## Critical Next Action\n\n**Execute module-brief workflow NOW using Express Mode:**\n\n1. Start workflow: `/bmad:bmb:workflows:module-brief` (already running when context was cleared)\n2. Mode: Express Mode (minimize questions, generate from existing docs)\n3. Use existing TeachFlow documentation to auto-populate most fields\n4. Ask user only for gaps: personality theme, user scenarios, success metrics, risks, creative features\n5. Generate complete brief document\n6.

Four core agents handle primary teaching responsibilities and can delegate to four specialized supporting agents.\n\n### Agent Roster\n\n**CORE AGENTS (4)**\n\n**1. Instructional Designer** 📚\n- **Role**: Expert in teaching and learning activities\n- **Personality**: Pedagogically sound, creative, student-centered educator\n- **Key Capabilities**: \n  - Lesson planning and curriculum design\n  - Assessment creation and rubrics\n  - Unit and course planning\n  - Differentiation strategies\n  - Student goal setting\n- **Signature Commands**: `/plan` (lesson planning), `/assess` (create assessments), `/differentiate` (adapt for learners)\n- **Can Delegate To**: Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, Report Generator, Goal Tracker\n\n**2. Behavior Specialist** 🎯\n- **Role**: Manages behavior documentation and parent communication\n- **Personality**: Empathetic yet objective, solution-focused, professional\n- **Key Capabilities**:\n  - Behavior incident documentation\n  - Parent communication drafting\n  - Classroom management planning\n  - Intervention strategies\n  - Behavioral pattern analysis\n- **Signature Commands**: `/incident` (document behavior), `/communicate` (parent email), `/manage` (management plans)\n- **Can Delegate To**: Report Generator\n\n**3. Professional Writer** ✍️\n- **Role**: Handles administrative paperwork and professional correspondence\n- **Personality**: Formal, clear, administratively savvy\n- **Key Capabilities**:\n  - Professional correspondence\n  - Administrative forms and reports\n  - Meeting documentation\n  - Policy interpretation\n  - General writing support\n- **Signature Commands**: `/write` (professional documents), `/correspondence` (formal letters), `/document` (meeting notes)\n- **Can Delegate To**: None (specialized standalone writer)\n\n**4.

Resource Curator** 🔍\n- **Role**: Finds and organizes teaching materials\n- **Supports**: Instructional Designer\n- **Specialty**: Curating lesson resources, multimedia content, teaching materials\n\n**6. Accommodation Specialist** ♿\n- **Role**: Special needs and differentiation support\n- **Supports**: Instructional Designer\n- **Specialty**: IEP support, accessibility guidance, inclusive practices\n\n**7. Report Generator** 📈\n- **Role**: Creates visual reports and dashboards\n- **Supports**: All core agents\n- **Specialty**: Data visualization, formatted reports, presentation materials\n\n**8. Goal Tracker** 🎯\n- **Role**: Monitors objectives and learning progress\n- **Supports**: Instructional Designer, Data Analyst\n- **Specialty**: Learning objective tracking, milestone monitoring, achievement documentation\n\n### Agent Interaction Model\n\nHow agents work together:\n\n```\nDELEGATION HIERARCHY\n\nInstructional Designer (Orchestrator)\n  ├─→ Resource Curator (finds teaching materials)\n  ├─→ Accommodation Specialist (differentiation strategies)\n  ├─→ Report Generator (lesson planning visuals)\n  └─→ Goal Tracker (learning objective monitoring)\n\nBehavior Specialist (Focused)\n  └─→ Report Generator (incident visualization)\n\nProfessional Writer (Standalone)\n  └─ No delegation - specialized writing expertise\n\nData Analyst (Analytical)\n  ├─→ Report Generator (data visualization)\n  └─→ Goal Tracker (progress tracking)\n```\n\n**Collaboration Pattern**:\n1. User interacts with a core agent\n2. Core agent assesses task complexity\n3. If specialized support needed, delegates to supporting agent(s)\n4. Supporting agents complete subtasks\n5. Core agent integrates results and delivers to user\n\nThis mirrors how teaching professionals actually collaborate in schools - lead teachers working with specialists to deliver comprehensive student support.\n\nContinue [c] or Edit [e]?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1133,"cache_read_input_tokens":76775,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1133,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CU8BB9yfexYSDXhtfFJZH","type":"assistant","uuid":"84ec3363-de9c-4314-bb3a-352bbc5b2c59","timestamp":"2025-10-15T02:14:21.567Z"}

Alpha - Student Support Agent** 🎓\n- **Role**: Direct student learning support with adaptive teaching personality\n- **Personality**: Triple personality system (student selects preference):\n  - **Socratic Guide**: Question-based discovery learning\n  - **Study Buddy**: Collaborative peer-helper style  \n  - **Expert Tutor**: Structured professional instruction\n- **Key Capabilities**:\n  - Homework help through guided learning (never direct answers)\n  - Concept explanations with worked examples\n  - Study strategy coaching\n  - Practice problem generation\n  - Assignment clarification\n  - Exam preparation support\n  - Study guide creation\n- **Signature Commands**: `/help` (primary support), `/explain` (concepts), `/practice` (problems), `/stuck` (troubleshooting), `/study` (materials), `/quiz` (self-assessment), `/switch` (change personality)\n- **Can Delegate To**: Resource Curator, Report Generator, Goal Tracker\n- **Target Audience**: Middle school students (ages 11-14)\n- **Safety Features**: Academic integrity protection, PG-13 content, emotional safety, growth mindset reinforcement\n- **Unique Value**: Dual-mode operation (direct student use + teacher delegation for student material creation)\n\n**SUPPORTING AGENTS (5)**\n\n**6. Resource Curator** 🔍\n- **Role**: Finds and organizes teaching and learning materials\n- **Supports**: Instructional Designer, Alpha\n- **Specialty**: Curating lesson resources, multimedia content, teaching materials, student practice resources\n\n**7. Accommodation Specialist** ♿\n- **Role**: Special needs and differentiation support\n- **Supports**: Instructional Designer\n- **Specialty**: IEP support, accessibility guidance, inclusive practices, differentiation strategies\n\n**8. Report Generator** 📈\n- **Role**: Creates visual reports, dashboards, and formatted materials\n- **Supports**: All core agents\n- **Specialty**: \n  - Data visualization and charts (for Data Analyst, Behavior Specialist)\n  - Formatted reports and dashboards\n  - Study guides and graphic organizers (for Alpha, Instructional Designer)\n  - Presentation materials and visual aids\n\n**9. Goal Tracker** 🎯\n- **Role**: Monitors objectives and learning progress\n- **Supports**: Instructional Designer, Data Analyst, Alpha\n- **Specialty**: Learning objective tracking, IEP goal monitoring, milestone tracking, achievement documentation, student progress visualization\n\n**10. Standards Aligner** 📋\n- **Role**: Standards alignment and curriculum mapping\n- **Supports**: Instructional Designer\n- **Specialty**: Academic standards alignment (Common Core, NGSS, state standards), curriculum mapping, learning objective correlation, standards-based assessment design\n\n### Agent Interaction Model\n\nHow agents work together:\n\n```\nDELEGATION HIERARCHY\n\nInstructional Designer (Orchestrator)\n  ├─→ Resource Curator (teaching materials)\n  ├─→ Accommodation Specialist (differentiation strategies)\n  ├─→ Standards Aligner (standards alignment)\n  ├─→ Report Generator (graphic organizers, visual aids)\n  └─→ Goal Tracker (learning objective monitoring)\n\nBehavior Specialist (Focused)\n  └─→ Report Generator (incident visualization, behavior charts)\n\nProfessional Writer (Standalone)\n  └─ No delegation - specialized writing expertise\n\nData Analyst (Analytical)\n  ├─→ Report Generator (data visualization, progress charts)\n  └─→ Goal Tracker (progress tracking, trend analysis)\n\nAlpha - Student Support Agent (Student-Facing/Dual-Mode)\n  ├─→ Resource Curator (practice materials, learning resources)\n  ├─→ Report Generator (study guides, concept maps, flashcards)\n  └─→ Goal Tracker (student progress monitoring, achievement tracking)\n```\n\n**Collaboration Patterns**:\n\n*Teacher-Focused Workflow:*\n1. Teacher interacts with core agent (Instructional Designer, Behavior Specialist, etc.)\n2. Core agent assesses task complexity\n3. If specialized support needed, delegates to supporting agent(s)\n4. Supporting agents complete subtasks\n5. Core agent integrates results and delivers to teacher\n\n*Student-Focused Workflow (Alpha):*\n1. Student loads Alpha directly OR teacher delegates to Alpha for student materials\n2. Alpha selects/confirms personality mode with student\n3. Alpha provides guided learning (never direct answers)\n4. Alpha delegates to supporting agents for resources/materials as needed\n5. Alpha tracks student progress and provides encouragement\n\nThis mirrors how teaching professionals actually collaborate in schools - lead teachers working with specialists to deliver comprehensive student support, with students also having direct access to learning assistance.\n\nContinue [c] or Edit [e]?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":11,"cache_creation_input_tokens":677,"cache_read_input_tokens":86037,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":677,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CU8CCKT5VpdnP3WidWaue","type":"assistant","uuid":"f5581e50-4fe3-4938-88df-99b1073876a0","timestamp":"2025-10-15T02:27:58.651Z"}

It streamlines all aspects of teaching work - from lesson planning to behavior documentation to data analysis - allowing educators to focus more on students and less on paperwork.\n\nThe module solves the critical problem of **teacher administrative burden**. Teachers spend countless hours on lesson planning, behavior documentation, progress reports, and administrative paperwork - time that could be better spent with students. TeachFlow automates and streamlines these tasks while maintaining professional quality and educational rigor.\n\nWhat makes TeachFlow exciting is its **intelligent delegation model**: core teaching agents can automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating efficient collaborative workflows that mirror how teaching teams actually work in schools.\n\n**Module Category:** Domain-Specific (Education)\n**Complexity Level:** Standard (moderate integrations, delegation patterns)\n**Target Users:** K-12 Teachers (all subjects, science focus initially)\n\n---\n\n## Module Identity\n\n### Core Concept\n\nTeachFlow is a comprehensive teaching workflow automation system that transforms the way educators manage their professional responsibilities.

Teacher interacts with core agent (Instructional Designer, Behavior Specialist, etc.)\n2. Core agent assesses task complexity\n3. If specialized support needed, delegates to supporting agent(s)\n4. Supporting agents complete subtasks\n5. Core agent integrates results and delivers to teacher\n\n*Student-Focused Workflow (Alpha):*\n1. Student loads Alpha directly OR teacher delegates to Alpha for student materials\n2. Alpha selects/confirms personality mode with student\n3. Alpha provides guided learning (never direct answers)\n4. Alpha delegates to supporting agents for resources/materials as needed\n5. Alpha tracks student progress and provides encouragement\n\nThis mirrors how teaching professionals actually collaborate in schools - lead teachers working with specialists to deliver comprehensive student support, with students also having direct access to learning assistance.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Ecosystem\n\n{{workflow_ecosystem}}\n\n### Core Workflows\n\nEssential functionality that delivers primary value:\n{{core_workflows}}\n\n### Feature Workflows\n\nSpecialized capabilities that enhance the module:\n{{feature_workflows}}\n\n### Utility Workflows\n\nSupporting operations and maintenance:\n{{utility_workflows}}\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n{{primary_scenario}}\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n{{secondary_scenarios}}\n\n### User Journey\n\nStep-by-step walkthrough of typical usage:\n{{user_journey}}\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

Unit Planning workflow removed. Now we have 9 workflows total.\n\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\nContinuing with workflow...\n\n## **STEP 6: User Scenarios** ✓\n\nNow I need to create user journey scenarios. Based on the context document, this was identified as a gap that needs user input. However, since we're in Express Mode and I have solid understanding of the module, let me generate realistic teaching scenarios:\n\n**User Scenarios Generated:**\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n**Scenario: Daily Lesson Planning (High School Science Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a high school biology teacher, I want to create a detailed lesson plan for photosynthesis that includes hands-on activities, formative assessments, and differentiation for my IEP students, so that I can deliver engaging, standards-aligned instruction in 45 minutes of prep time instead of 2+ hours.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (9th), standards (NGSS), time (90 min block), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\nContinue [c] or Edit [e]?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":12,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2456,"cache_read_input_tokens":93931,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2456,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CU8L1e3tRKgzeK8azFuhV","type":"assistant","uuid":"28b2fa25-dcac-41d0-ab84-e3889669ce67","timestamp":"2025-10-15T04:10:15.339Z"}

Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10.

Removes a lot of complexity around cloud storage, security, compliance. Local storage means files in the project directory.\n\n2. **PII not a concern** - Since it's all local, no cloud privacy issues. But we should still be thoughtful about what gets stored.\n\n3. **Student profiles on as-needed basis** - Good approach. Not pre-populated, created when teacher needs them for specific students.\n\n4. **Standards data** - User can provide all the standards data (NGSS, Common Core, etc.) and wants my recommendation on optimal storage format.\n\nLet me think about optimal storage for standards data:\n\n**Options for Standards Storage:**\n\n1. **JSON files** - Structured, easy to parse, can nest hierarchies (grade → domain → standard → performance expectation)\n   - Pros: Human-readable, easy to query, good for hierarchical data\n   - Cons: Can get large, needs parsing\n\n2. **Markdown with YAML frontmatter** - Documentation-friendly, searchable\n   - Pros: Very readable, can include descriptions and examples\n   - Cons: Harder to programmatically query\n\n3. **CSV files** - Simple, flat structure\n   - Pros: Easy to create, edit in spreadsheet\n   - Cons: Poor for hierarchical data, loses relationships\n\n4. **Hybrid approach**: \n   - JSON for machine-readable queries (Standards Aligner agent uses this)\n   - Markdown documentation for human reference (teachers browsing standards)\n\nI think I should recommend:\n- **Primary storage**: JSON files organized by standard type and grade level\n  - `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/ngss/grade-7.json`\n  - `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/common-core-ela/grade-7.json`\n  - `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/common-core-math/grade-7.json`\n  - `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/state-specific/[state]/grade-7.json`\n\nI'll extend the storage strategy to include state-specific standards. This allows for maximum flexibility and granularity in standards management. The path structure maintains consistency across different standard types, making it easy to locate and manage educational standards programmatically.\n\nThe state-specific JSON will follow the same hierarchical structure as other standard sets, ensuring uniform data access and parsing across different educational frameworks.","signature":"EpoWCkYICBgCKkB38uhEgS8xHTbajWU1For0CsEmzy8T9g7XFy8i7Um+RBsozFY01U4zvcdr5qmBRnY6wP8roSlu1b/AaZE+yw7xEgwEzAuu3ru6g5TSnoYaDARo4ySHDE7WRdSOXSIwnUDP2W8JaJDYXQC2gd6fRJDp/4b7wWS+R8t+hCja/cThog3SiRUoHDWkwfMrvqnZKoEVNmbBD4eI0s8VKADcR49dVMEz+/cUVMzCty6B9usjCor0861jeATxsuOfrnZ9YalC/jINULr6D2loxaeTK7/fvNbQfcQsBwXdO28Blj4BnpnG4bMyftWJbZ+1rfHsQ/+zo7YtgWAQmg3G/oQJEQJhZIOjFuhewICxKkAy7oGJdT2/FsvaHOm86zKnjVGLbDniACor+bHuO03MivRYyD/pt6ZevdetkYhzMr6q/L/Kxm6YFhkxlefBJsh/sBJI1eMTm/czFgVpOV5ufWmWnFDRu6RbHjbLed6qvo/jsCjR5OS6CkdhkuRMSupZZ4f8k4PmLbV4U/vH4UbN0T89ZGFRo4G05c6xaesAwugYldA1cVbgNVMRi3Yfj/nc3WaefJNt63cuJi4MGmSmNMLAKy3JP/SozxHJJQt6gTKXdDXirhSDAULo6P+UadfQ0t8rLACHJ5AFlZLzVlGUF2ULWl9LtTsm474oZCWuR+ar69JoTK8i0xoU9UwBlKgdkWqTY0ocugNj0EhIJadWc784MGzrbT2Kbm9kQwla6NNOqGQ6uOFVJgTzqXJfP+bAltai2B8Qh86xh8ntPFr19v+flHcvf6Iqi1vMFjlsER88g/EQvFGevTmvf7R/uVQPPvmgryY0EHtWNahOQBfom43XMuJqr+9k3TOVofxqheWgFqn0cgYT/sA5iSX7gu97sZgBY/kvAcbHiXqWtwyJ6aiRTRGgQ4dtQRZVPIsaricCq+LjaLnHXR/CKfE3Lt8Aj25CNC5OaY3RzePh3yKEHSy1nl+tg0qntdXUsnY+v0Cnfx5wB7IPkFzqx0PARiKg6F52LZBoS+cpaCLnAwtbaLFvfaYqFhMa3cE2aOEIHQQuE/IzcQu4F7XDP/JJhfgQDDolqO0xywzFOcqV4myKjYcsJ2h/5V7BmTWmNwVNhhuXTKrlj/FWLNMTJgInk+4YSs0GeqMcDmnEBSypLf1SnomYnWwsFmZECDs+iI5JqO8fHGywtVpaLGXs1Kvxu5IJbkbjlhUqiiGV5E6UpX0wnkGdn5ToQcO7PWd5KNsXZ29mrnYyULyHZdmtJyBcH83mgGh8xzKNAywnD8k6gQeduG43MnA2QGD07ncM6aA2ntD0fe+45ssEyxqI+OMjQ6lwFizUieQoFfSFRdl4FvJ+Cys3V1RUxK4tRgkoRFNeK0n/sh4ZOxdXDH0JyGRWd0vRhOMMgW75dSyH8De9hiUYuzpvHUdiqaVpR85vp54Fljs+imYUm9n4xzDBgmlVGkv9jObi5O64ecgjopLDZ9973aY7b7BKOodTwwsGlFTWFGE7mBxLPi9j6rOE1SV3hHuaIV+SLJmHEAeyj7Qv5lsSZm1CV0On48KJn3Jc9YkndzuC2CcStPYRFQbUrrMRXocx/XUXUiGfs3oMg4Kouz/K5jpyL0IgzX+nZ7iZvt8X8KkLudkWX7jeHS2x3W4LrJfmoTVXyfBMUAgHBDvd6N+p50Afqowga+A0X6Yye8Jg3EvDq9H/Wo0PmwUw58pV3wzZ0Yj9oPFMWWFhnu6U+6Q6aUMJJd3/ydVB2eWuWBYej5oALkoGwwayt6EYwZY2iDE1QeXS3+ItGGhhxjsu648vAAgkoiQ1NHg5iGu09S/SuYs0s+nktr7Y1DtkkeZWfHiwY4iTCX24lsNTA4T851oppMXXYc+IOuJpbemzL+2+IcamrDX6cKHSpP+jzsIsaYLxgv7YrwOgGuZK6nPxpFdMOnYGNQY5Tzl0+6tbmYodSt1/plecCQcI2O23IKw0NdGtAG5KsgJpZuWdgHCa5wmIz/46v9Xh8HePXRxHPRGQIfe2XW73TnKqJxWCREBSCPyiHPZO8eFD+j/L3qAYzXqR+fiYXko14Ty2X7BEPuRYCMDt05ulG83KZG28LEorfpLNtNjwybSD5iOWknlmAazgCusFyl3d1+tWC8khLfidd0rYX1PYeqi7WSneEgiWjh/8Apnl20avkshn3JCOJuNoXl8Kdk498oLGUcT8dHvDaLnBzXXRWgYmSKk3UHv4mqF+RiLkfTo3Wmul1MShK5ed5CGr7R2xPEmQSM+pozsHkYR1cbCogFYFJw4IvjcDPcfyCyabre5Wsf+zwNKul470pBfL+eFtg7Ug9LuCGNIgrNlCTmtAINEXBEOBxrTr4mjVzbg1oV00KfqkSGJy7E8jkXyRj3+ebcr/JO/6Q6Nl3957quYxnKZFrXWg8hAh3v2tRqBb1cw1svD6iSyLH1PXbAgztVm9GtCzBSWPvfn2CZ3Nb5TGsbAyfCL4r4G7RUuOtdLKuqRMPeMDQMcv0u1apbmN6AJhlCMezjF6++pcoaKByM6KFeV75dd6cIo21onm9lauoPVigjx57OcnUeflBcXg/1qP21IzikKsscNilwVOXXd3QtJPhA5bUlIUHGFLafhQe9G+5ZMomC0r69A9KelTd592Qepn7nHe5cs/VMwoCXTJGkE/ZSn3Q/43iKTna+YNzItFD283rPFjgGKcl2P5XIaHmL6aGF55VL6w1gHQMahwu4/jR2QEGgsgwBQMPQrxWvXEyENVa749EHJ2ONdK6zT+mZnVgMGbZvfTeYHcr0KKgDK+rtQxERyHLMK5tpKzDvrV0we/ThyscwztaKm+LpaVN/rrcT0knFK72tcnb9yp+DW13Fzrqnu2HoDjoo0uZNpu4w30Mo+tDJ3JqbCs41qzfDViBjF6QcV8W9R5slJBA2ZFqFEtG0R2KOwGcVS1QOAbfqM7lLU2XkQuk4el0VQIkPR2dfHtJlWrUxRImPSvZJedl9c0n1O2gT3nfQEpB7xtOiOE7/IPAIIXXdQklc8rVl8zG3ekTystqdaI56nu/j5fMhzp2Er3Wwzd7j7Gzf8udBx2mNCY+eoBEEcjGFTi3ROzgxvARQCZ4JZAEq3YSwTf7ByNIujnP07OPJ0zisyG8H9Dnp49wyVFjs3XW7fxlJBuDqtp9qUfu8ZBIvKk2Fau980DsfaRljdl9UkWrkuN40gHvSWfudzbbR3zJ8EdpQOUktkjopgHYz3nk0p38OWKcHVzhUZ6eLk+wGEVBUUNwPPtUPK8HcvLi4N08lGHkwG+XScgUOCYfkhCpPkvyMeYRV19z9PDKQy4q6pJzI/SxHX5e9VPcRvCmrhgYjkjWfK7IgeVut3+7nTFf28L9wRk27PDmSYt9l3qdO56HE8VAqF3ASWsM4v4QNofz7Bw7xm/2xp4aoDecKJ+l7Th4FQHxUe7SGEBDSW0cMLAZNHf9nZzV4zWXBd+f8DyH1wiyTaKuHdjHa/w2Bvs5DWRYC9yvFaTn3JkehxV10+CZAhk69fD8zQHOdLeZyzzIrFfM1LugBRmKQLSMnPCrTcj41nqfSZh7109/LDDWiPLY6bcBmJ4v+5CC1vjpd2/z22g3BkLecWrdKwMhW+IutImCtSRURnWnWX/+/o3M77opOqTVdeLgZerGlzNGrrBsGC8JI5OYn34x/A2B2Qw7yOMQpCcrvDlEBV6k1C7rjsbspr2fbYZo2+VjJDoTOmyUTOPWzDq5R57mUjOOJqBCXCZYWkZPgOSX4azLEY/54OzsgLFVRgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2873,"cache_read_input_tokens":99204,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2873,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CU8LTMw11Gba6YWhNAxsz","type":"assistant","uuid":"91bc6265-dc18-4992-8b9a-9ce9ed38c571","timestamp":"2025-10-15T04:15:59.797Z"}

What's the driving question for what you're working on?\"\n- Student: \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\"\n- Alpha queries standards database by driving question → Gets exact lesson + 3D components\n- **Benefit**: Specific, memorable, maps directly to standards\n\n**Step 3: Precision Scoping**\n- Alpha now knows:\n  - **SEP scope**: Help student construct explanations (not just recall facts)\n  - **DCI scope**: Focus on energy transformation concepts (not all of photosynthesis)\n  - **CCC scope**: Guide thinking about energy and matter flow\n- This prevents:\n  - ❌ Teaching too much (going beyond lesson scope)\n  - ❌ Teaching too little (missing key dimensions)\n\n**Step 4: 3D-Guided Teaching**\n- If student asks: \"What is photosynthesis?\"\n- Alpha (using 3D components):\n  - Focuses on **energy transformation** (DCI)\n  - Guides student to **construct explanation** (SEP) not just memorize\n  - Connects to **energy/matter flow** (CCC)\n- Instead of generic definition, Alpha: \"Let's think about what happens to light energy when it hits a plant leaf. What do you think changes?\"\n\n**Fallback**: If student doesn't know driving question:\n- \"What topic are you studying?\" → \"Photosynthesis\"\n- Alpha: \"Got it! Is your driving question something like 'How do plants get energy?' or 'Why are plants green?'\"\n- Match to closest lesson in database\n\nShould I:\n1. Update the Technical Planning section with this 3D-enhanced standards structure?\n2. Create a dedicated \"3-Dimensional Learning Integration\" section?\n3. Revise Alpha's workflow documentation with the driving question approach?\n4.

Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

Alpha tracks student progress and provides encouragement\n\nThis mirrors how teaching professionals actually collaborate in schools - lead teachers working with specialists to deliver comprehensive student support, with students also having direct access to learning assistance.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Ecosystem\n\nTeachFlow provides **9 comprehensive workflows** categorized by primary function and frequency of use.\n\n### Core Workflows\n\nEssential functionality that delivers primary value (most frequently used):\n\n**1. Lesson Plan Builder** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive, 3D-informed NGSS lesson plans\n- **Input**: Learning objectives, grade level, subject, time allocation\n- **Process**:\n  1. Interactive planning (gather lesson context)\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve standard code + 3D components (SEP, DCI, CCC)\n  3. **3D-informed activity sequencing** (activities must engage SEP, develop DCI, highlight CCC)\n  4. **3D-aligned assessment creation** (assess SEP performance, DCI understanding, CCC application)\n  5. Differentiation strategies\n- **Output**: Complete lesson plan with objectives, 3D-aligned activities, dimensional assessments, and materials list\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures every lesson engages all three dimensions of NGSS learning, not just content coverage\n\n**2. Behavior Incident Report** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Document behavioral incidents and generate parent communications\n- **Input**: Incident details (who, what, when, where, context)\n- **Process**: Interview-style data collection → objective documentation → parent email generation → follow-up actions\n- **Output**: Professional parent email + detailed incident report + action items\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**3. Progress Report Generator** (Data Analyst)\n- **Purpose**: Create data-driven student progress reports\n- **Input**: Student data (grades, assessments, observations)\n- **Process**: Data aggregation → trend analysis → visualization → narrative generation\n- **Output**: Standards-based progress report with charts and recommendations\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n### Feature Workflows\n\nSpecialized capabilities that enhance the module (periodic use):\n\n**4. Assessment Creation** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Create tests, quizzes, and rubrics aligned to standards\n- **Input**: Learning objectives, item types, difficulty levels\n- **Process**: Item generation → alignment checking → rubric creation → formatting\n- **Output**: Complete assessment with answer key and rubric\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**5. Differentiation Strategies** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Adapt instruction for diverse learners\n- **Input**: Lesson content, student needs, learning profiles\n- **Process**: Needs analysis → strategy selection → modification design\n- **Output**: Differentiation plan with specific adaptations\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**6. Student Goal Setting** (Instructional Designer + Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Facilitate student goal-setting sessions\n- **Input**: Student current performance, target areas\n- **Process**: Goal identification → SMART criteria → action planning → monitoring setup\n- **Output**: Student goal-setting worksheet and tracking plan\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n**7. Classroom Management Plans** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Develop comprehensive classroom management strategies\n- **Input**: Grade level, class dynamics, challenges\n- **Process**: Assessment → strategy selection → procedure development → implementation planning\n- **Output**: Complete classroom management plan document\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**8. Parent Communication Templates** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Generate professional parent communications for various scenarios\n- **Input**: Communication purpose, context, tone preference\n- **Process**: Template selection → customization → tone adjustment → formatting\n- **Output**: Ready-to-send parent communication (email, letter, note)\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n### Utility Workflows\n\nSupporting operations specific to student learning (Alpha-specific):\n\n**9. Student Support Session** (Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Provide 3D-scoped guided learning support to students\n- **Input**: Lesson driving question OR topic, what student is stuck on, what they've tried\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Driving question identification** (\"What's your lesson's driving question?\")\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve 3D scope (SEP skill, DCI concept, CCC thinking pattern)\n  3. Personality selection (Socratic Guide / Study Buddy / Expert Tutor)\n  4. **3D-scoped teaching interaction**:\n     - Focus on lesson's DCI (concept scope)\n     - Practice lesson's SEP (skill development)\n     - Apply lesson's CCC (thinking pattern)\n     - Use worked examples of SIMILAR problems (not homework answers)\n  5. Understanding check (can student explain/apply?)\n  6. Resource provision (practice materials, study guides)\n- **Output**: Student understanding aligned to lesson scope + practice materials + progress tracking\n- **Complexity**: Complex (multi-personality, 3D scoping, safety-critical)\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures student help precisely matches what teacher taught - prevents confusion from scope mismatch\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n**Scenario: Daily Lesson Planning (Middle School Science Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a middle school science teacher, I want to create a detailed lesson plan for photosynthesis that includes hands-on activities, formative assessments, and differentiation for my IEP students, so that I can deliver engaging, standards-aligned instruction in 45 minutes of prep time instead of 2+ hours.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n{{data_requirements}}\n\n### Integration Points\n\n{{integration_points}}\n\n### Dependencies\n\n{{dependencies}}\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n{{technical_planning}}\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the module is successful:\n{{success_criteria}}\n\n### Quality Standards\n\n{{quality_standards}}\n\n### Performance Targets\n\n{{performance_targets}}\n\n---\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Module)\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase1_timeline}}\n\n{{phase1_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase1_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 2: Enhancement\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase2_timeline}}\n\n{{phase2_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase2_deliverables}}\n\n### Phase 3: Polish and Optimization\n\n**Timeline:** {{phase3_timeline}}\n\n{{phase3_components}}\n\n**Deliverables:**\n{{phase3_deliverables}}\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n{{creative_features}}\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n{{easter_eggs}}\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n{{module_lore}}\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n{{technical_risks}}\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n{{usability_risks}}\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n{{scope_risks}}\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n\n{{risk_mitigation}}\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. {{priority_1}}\n2. {{priority_2}}\n3. {{priority_3}}\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n{{design_decisions}}\n\n### Open Questions\n\n{{open_questions}}\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

Student Support Session** (Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Provide 3D-scoped guided learning support to students\n- **Input**: Lesson driving question OR topic, what student is stuck on, what they've tried\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Driving question identification** (\"What's your lesson's driving question?\")\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve 3D scope (SEP skill, DCI concept, CCC thinking pattern)\n  3. Personality selection (Socratic Guide / Study Buddy / Expert Tutor)\n  4. **3D-scoped teaching interaction**:\n     - Focus on lesson's DCI (concept scope)\n     - Practice lesson's SEP (skill development)\n     - Apply lesson's CCC (thinking pattern)\n     - Use worked examples of SIMILAR problems (not homework answers)\n  5. Understanding check (can student explain/apply?)\n  6. Resource provision (practice materials, study guides)\n- **Output**: Student understanding aligned to lesson scope + practice materials + progress tracking\n- **Complexity**: Complex (multi-personality, 3D scoping, safety-critical)\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures student help precisely matches what teacher taught - prevents confusion from scope mismatch\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n**Scenario: Daily Lesson Planning (Middle School Science Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a middle school science teacher, I want to create a detailed lesson plan for photosynthesis that includes hands-on activities, formative assessments, and differentiation for my IEP students, so that I can deliver engaging, standards-aligned instruction in 45 minutes of prep time instead of 2+ hours.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Alpha delegates to supporting agents for resources/materials as needed\n5. Alpha tracks student progress and provides encouragement\n\nThis mirrors how teaching professionals actually collaborate in schools - lead teachers working with specialists to deliver comprehensive student support, with students also having direct access to learning assistance.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Ecosystem\n\nTeachFlow provides **9 comprehensive workflows** categorized by primary function and frequency of use.\n\n### Core Workflows\n\nEssential functionality that delivers primary value (most frequently used):\n\n**1. Lesson Plan Builder** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive, 3D-informed NGSS lesson plans\n- **Input**: Learning objectives, grade level, subject, time allocation\n- **Process**:\n  1. Interactive planning (gather lesson context)\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve standard code + 3D components (SEP, DCI, CCC)\n  3. **3D-informed activity sequencing** (activities must engage SEP, develop DCI, highlight CCC)\n  4. **3D-aligned assessment creation** (assess SEP performance, DCI understanding, CCC application)\n  5. Differentiation strategies\n- **Output**: Complete lesson plan with objectives, 3D-aligned activities, dimensional assessments, and materials list\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures every lesson engages all three dimensions of NGSS learning, not just content coverage\n\n**2. Behavior Incident Report** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Document behavioral incidents and generate parent communications\n- **Input**: Incident details (who, what, when, where, context)\n- **Process**: Interview-style data collection → objective documentation → parent email generation → follow-up actions\n- **Output**: Professional parent email + detailed incident report + action items\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**3. Progress Report Generator** (Data Analyst)\n- **Purpose**: Create data-driven student progress reports\n- **Input**: Student data (grades, assessments, observations)\n- **Process**: Data aggregation → trend analysis → visualization → narrative generation\n- **Output**: Standards-based progress report with charts and recommendations\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n### Feature Workflows\n\nSpecialized capabilities that enhance the module (periodic use):\n\n**4. Assessment Creation** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Create tests, quizzes, and rubrics aligned to standards\n- **Input**: Learning objectives, item types, difficulty levels\n- **Process**: Item generation → alignment checking → rubric creation → formatting\n- **Output**: Complete assessment with answer key and rubric\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**5. Differentiation Strategies** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Adapt instruction for diverse learners\n- **Input**: Lesson content, student needs, learning profiles\n- **Process**: Needs analysis → strategy selection → modification design\n- **Output**: Differentiation plan with specific adaptations\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**6. Student Goal Setting** (Instructional Designer + Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Facilitate student goal-setting sessions\n- **Input**: Student current performance, target areas\n- **Process**: Goal identification → SMART criteria → action planning → monitoring setup\n- **Output**: Student goal-setting worksheet and tracking plan\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n**7. Classroom Management Plans** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Develop comprehensive classroom management strategies\n- **Input**: Grade level, class dynamics, challenges\n- **Process**: Assessment → strategy selection → procedure development → implementation planning\n- **Output**: Complete classroom management plan document\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**8. Parent Communication Templates** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Generate professional parent communications for various scenarios\n- **Input**: Communication purpose, context, tone preference\n- **Process**: Template selection → customization → tone adjustment → formatting\n- **Output**: Ready-to-send parent communication (email, letter, note)\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n### Utility Workflows\n\nSupporting operations specific to student learning (Alpha-specific):\n\n**9. Student Support Session** (Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Provide 3D-scoped guided learning support to students\n- **Input**: Lesson driving question OR topic, what student is stuck on, what they've tried\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Driving question identification** (\"What's your lesson's driving question?\")\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve 3D scope (SEP skill, DCI concept, CCC thinking pattern)\n  3. Personality selection (Socratic Guide / Study Buddy / Expert Tutor)\n  4. **3D-scoped teaching interaction**:\n     - Focus on lesson's DCI (concept scope)\n     - Practice lesson's SEP (skill development)\n     - Apply lesson's CCC (thinking pattern)\n     - Use worked examples of SIMILAR problems (not homework answers)\n  5. Understanding check (can student explain/apply?)\n  6. Resource provision (practice materials, study guides)\n- **Output**: Student understanding aligned to lesson scope + practice materials + progress tracking\n- **Complexity**: Complex (multi-personality, 3D scoping, safety-critical)\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures student help precisely matches what teacher taught - prevents confusion from scope mismatch\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n**Scenario: Daily Lesson Planning (Middle School Science Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a middle school science teacher, I want to create a detailed lesson plan for photosynthesis that includes hands-on activities, formative assessments, and differentiation for my IEP students, so that I can deliver engaging, standards-aligned instruction in 45 minutes of prep time instead of 2+ hours.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Data needs to be structured in this format.\n\n**Normalization Strategy for Driving Questions**:\n- Lowercase all text\n- Remove punctuation\n- Stem to core question (e.g., \"How do plants get energy?\" and \"How do plants get the energy they need?\" both map to same lesson)\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n**Storage Needs** (all local, no cloud):\n- **3D Standards Database**: NGSS (priority), Common Core ELA/Math, state standards (structured as above)\n- **Templates**: Lesson plan templates, assessment formats, communication templates, study guide formats\n- **Student Profiles** (on-demand): Anonymous learning profiles created as needed for differentiation, goal tracking\n- **Usage Analytics**: Workflow usage patterns, agent delegation frequency (for optimization)\n\n**Data Sources**:\n- NGSS standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- Common Core standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- User-created templates and customizations\n- Session data for Goal Tracker and progress monitoring\n- **No PII storage** (all data local only)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal BMAD Modules**:\n- Potentially integrate with other education-focused BMAD modules (if developed)\n- Share template library across education modules\n\n**External Tools/Platforms** (future):\n- **LMS Integration**: Export lesson plans to Canvas, Google Classroom, Schoology\n- **Resource Libraries**: Integration with educational resource sites (Teachers Pay Teachers, ReadWorks, PhET simulations)\n\n**Import/Export Formats**:\n- **Export**: PDF (lesson plans, reports), Word/Google Docs (editable documents), CSV (data exports)\n- **Import**: CSV (student data for analytics), Standards files (JSON)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n**BMAD Framework Dependencies**:\n- Core BMAD system for agent/workflow execution\n- Template system for document generation\n- Delegation framework for agent-to-agent communication\n\n**External Dependencies**:\n- None required for MVP\n- Optional: Web search for Resource Curator\n- Optional: Standards database APIs (alternative to local storage)\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n**Complexity Level: Standard → Moderate** (elevated due to 3D Learning integration)\n\n**Moderate Complexity Elements**:\n- Agent delegation system (core agents → supporting agents)\n- Multi-personality mode for Alpha (3 distinct interaction styles)\n- Template-based document generation across multiple formats\n- **3D Learning data structure** (dual-index, normalization, scope provision)\n- **Standards Aligner intelligence** (driving question matching, 3D component provision)\n\n**Low Complexity Elements**:\n- Individual agent personalities (well-defined roles)\n- Interview-style workflows (guided Q&A)\n- Static template rendering\n\n**High Complexity Elements**:\n- **Alpha agent**: Student-facing with safety requirements, academic integrity detection, emotional intelligence, **3D-scoped teaching precision**\n- **Standards Aligner**: Comprehensive standards database, driving question normalization, 3D component correlation\n\n**Mitigation Strategies**:\n- Phased development: Build Standards Aligner in Phase 1 (before dependent agents)\n- Template-first approach: Build robust templates before complex generation logic\n- Alpha developed in later phase after Standards Aligner proven\n- User provides standards data (reduces data collection complexity)\n- Start with NGSS middle school only (narrower scope for MVP)\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the

It streamlines all aspects of teaching work - from lesson planning to behavior documentation to data analysis - allowing educators to focus more on students and less on paperwork.\n\nThe module solves the critical problem of **teacher administrative burden**. Teachers spend countless hours on lesson planning, behavior documentation, progress reports, and administrative paperwork - time that could be better spent with students. TeachFlow automates and streamlines these tasks while maintaining professional quality and educational rigor.\n\nWhat makes TeachFlow exciting is its **intelligent delegation model**: core teaching agents can automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating efficient collaborative workflows that mirror how teaching teams actually work in schools.\n\n**Module Category:** Domain-Specific (Education)\n**Complexity Level:** Standard (moderate integrations, delegation patterns)\n**Target Users:** K-12 Teachers (all subjects, science focus initially)\n\n---\n\n## Module Identity\n\n### Core Concept\n\nTeachFlow is a comprehensive teaching workflow automation system that transforms the way educators manage their professional responsibilities. By combining specialized AI agents with intelligent workflow automation, it creates a digital teaching support team that handles the administrative burden while maintaining pedagogical excellence.\n\n### Unique Value Proposition\n\nWhat makes this module special:\n- **3-Dimensional Learning Framework**: Integrated NGSS 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC) ensures lessons aren't just standards-aligned but pedagogically sound.

Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

It streamlines all aspects of teaching work - from lesson planning to behavior documentation to data analysis - allowing educators to focus more on students and less on paperwork.\n\nThe module solves the critical problem of **teacher administrative burden**. Teachers spend countless hours on lesson planning, behavior documentation, progress reports, and administrative paperwork - time that could be better spent with students. TeachFlow automates and streamlines these tasks while maintaining professional quality and educational rigor.\n\nWhat makes TeachFlow exciting is its **intelligent delegation model**: core teaching agents can automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating efficient collaborative workflows that mirror how teaching teams actually work in schools.\n\n**Module Category:** Domain-Specific (Education)\n**Complexity Level:** Standard (moderate integrations, delegation patterns)\n**Target Users:** K-12 Teachers (all subjects, science focus initially)\n\n---\n\n## Module Identity\n\n### Core Concept\n\nTeachFlow is a comprehensive teaching workflow automation system that transforms the way educators manage their professional responsibilities. By combining specialized AI agents with intelligent workflow automation, it creates a digital teaching support team that handles the administrative burden while maintaining pedagogical excellence.\n\n### Unique Value Proposition\n\nWhat makes this module special:\n- **3-Dimensional Learning Framework**: Integrated NGSS 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC) ensures lessons aren't just standards-aligned but pedagogically sound. Instructional Designer builds lessons around all three dimensions, and Alpha provides student support scoped precisely to lesson objectives - preventing over-teaching or under-teaching.\n- **Intelligent Agent Delegation**: Core agents automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating collaborative workflows\n- **Domain Expertise**: Built specifically for K-12 education with deep understanding of teaching workflows, standards, and documentation requirements\n- **Complete Coverage**: Handles all teaching responsibilities - instruction, behavior, administration, and data analysis\n- **Professional Quality**: Generates standards-aligned, professionally formatted outputs ready for immediate use\n- **Time Multiplier**: Converts hours of administrative work into minutes of guided interaction\n\n### Personality Theme\n\n**\"The Professional Teaching Team\"** - Each agent embodies a different teaching specialist role with professional, supportive personalities:\n- Instructional Designer: Pedagogically sound, creative, student-centered\n- Behavior Specialist: Empathetic yet objective, solution-focused\n- Professional Writer: Formal, clear, administratively savvy\n- Data Analyst: Evidence-driven, insightful, action-oriented\n- Supporting specialists: Each brings focused expertise with collaborative spirit\n\nThe team maintains a consistent professional yet approachable tone, understanding the pressures teachers face while delivering high-quality solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Agent Architecture\n\nTeachFlow employs a **10-agent architecture** (5 core + 5 supporting) with a hierarchical delegation model. Five core agents handle primary teaching and student responsibilities and can delegate to five specialized supporting agents.\n\n### Agent Roster\n\n**CORE AGENTS (5)**\n\n**1.

Teacher interacts with core agent (Instructional Designer, Behavior Specialist, etc.)\n2. Core agent assesses task complexity\n3. If specialized support needed, delegates to supporting agent(s)\n4. Supporting agents complete subtasks\n5. Core agent integrates results and delivers to teacher\n\n*Student-Focused Workflow (Alpha):*\n1. Student loads Alpha directly OR teacher delegates to Alpha for student materials\n2. Alpha selects/confirms personality mode with student\n3. Alpha provides guided learning (never direct answers)\n4. Alpha delegates to supporting agents for resources/materials as needed\n5. Alpha tracks student progress and provides encouragement\n\nThis mirrors how teaching professionals actually collaborate in schools - lead teachers working with specialists to deliver comprehensive student support, with students also having direct access to learning assistance.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Ecosystem\n\nTeachFlow provides **9 comprehensive workflows** categorized by primary function and frequency of use.\n\n### Core Workflows\n\nEssential functionality that delivers primary value (most frequently used):\n\n**1. Lesson Plan Builder** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive, 3D-informed NGSS lesson plans\n- **Input**: Learning objectives, grade level, subject, time allocation\n- **Process**:\n  1. Interactive planning (gather lesson context)\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve standard code + 3D components (SEP, DCI, CCC)\n  3. **3D-informed activity sequencing** (activities must engage SEP, develop DCI, highlight CCC)\n  4. **3D-aligned assessment creation** (assess SEP performance, DCI understanding, CCC application)\n  5. Differentiation strategies\n- **Output**: Complete lesson plan with objectives, 3D-aligned activities, dimensional assessments, and materials list\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures every lesson engages all three dimensions of NGSS learning, not just content coverage\n\n**2.

Differentiation Strategies** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Adapt instruction for diverse learners\n- **Input**: Lesson content, student needs, learning profiles\n- **Process**: Needs analysis → strategy selection → modification design\n- **Output**: Differentiation plan with specific adaptations\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**6. Student Goal Setting** (Instructional Designer + Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Facilitate student goal-setting sessions\n- **Input**: Student current performance, target areas\n- **Process**: Goal identification → SMART criteria → action planning → monitoring setup\n- **Output**: Student goal-setting worksheet and tracking plan\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n**7. Classroom Management Plans** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Develop comprehensive classroom management strategies\n- **Input**: Grade level, class dynamics, challenges\n- **Process**: Assessment → strategy selection → procedure development → implementation planning\n- **Output**: Complete classroom management plan document\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**8. Parent Communication Templates** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Generate professional parent communications for various scenarios\n- **Input**: Communication purpose, context, tone preference\n- **Process**: Template selection → customization → tone adjustment → formatting\n- **Output**: Ready-to-send parent communication (email, letter, note)\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n### Utility Workflows\n\nSupporting operations specific to student learning (Alpha-specific):\n\n**9. Student Support Session** (Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Provide 3D-scoped guided learning support to students\n- **Input**: Lesson driving question OR topic, what student is stuck on, what they've tried\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Driving question identification** (\"What's your lesson's driving question?\")\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve 3D scope (SEP skill, DCI concept, CCC thinking pattern)\n  3. Personality selection (Socratic Guide / Study Buddy / Expert Tutor)\n  4. **3D-scoped teaching interaction**:\n     - Focus on lesson's DCI (concept scope)\n     - Practice lesson's SEP (skill development)\n     - Apply lesson's CCC (thinking pattern)\n     - Use worked examples of SIMILAR problems (not homework answers)\n  5. Understanding check (can student explain/apply?)\n  6. Resource provision (practice materials, study guides)\n- **Output**: Student understanding aligned to lesson scope + practice materials + progress tracking\n- **Complexity**: Complex (multi-personality, 3D scoping, safety-critical)\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures student help precisely matches what teacher taught - prevents confusion from scope mismatch\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n**Scenario: Daily Lesson Planning (Middle School Science Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a middle school science teacher, I want to create a detailed lesson plan for photosynthesis that includes hands-on activities, formative assessments, and differentiation for my IEP students, so that I can deliver engaging, standards-aligned instruction in 45 minutes of prep time instead of 2+ hours.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Data needs to be structured in this format.\n\n**Normalization Strategy for Driving Questions**:\n- Lowercase all text\n- Remove punctuation\n- Stem to core question (e.g., \"How do plants get energy?\" and \"How do plants get the energy they need?\" both map to same lesson)\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n**Storage Needs** (all local, no cloud):\n- **3D Standards Database**: NGSS (priority), Common Core ELA/Math, state standards (structured as above)\n- **Templates**: Lesson plan templates, assessment formats, communication templates, study guide formats\n- **Student Profiles** (on-demand): Anonymous learning profiles created as needed for differentiation, goal tracking\n- **Usage Analytics**: Workflow usage patterns, agent delegation frequency (for optimization)\n\n**Data Sources**:\n- NGSS standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- Common Core standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- User-created templates and customizations\n- Session data for

MVP\n- Optional: Web search for Resource Curator\n- Optional: Standards database APIs (alternative to local storage)\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n**Complexity Level: Standard → Moderate** (elevated due to 3D Learning integration)\n\n**Moderate Complexity Elements**:\n- Agent delegation system (core agents → supporting agents)\n- Multi-personality mode for Alpha (3 distinct interaction styles)\n- Template-based document generation across multiple formats\n- **3D Learning data structure** (dual-index, normalization, scope provision)\n- **Standards Aligner intelligence** (driving question matching, 3D component provision)\n\n**Low Complexity Elements**:\n- Individual agent personalities (well-defined roles)\n- Interview-style workflows (guided Q&A)\n- Static template rendering\n\n**High Complexity Elements**:\n- **Alpha agent**: Student-facing with safety requirements, academic integrity detection, emotional intelligence, **3D-scoped teaching precision**\n- **Standards Aligner**: Comprehensive standards database, driving question normalization, 3D component correlation\n\n**Mitigation Strategies**:\n- Phased development: Build Standards Aligner in Phase 1 (before dependent agents)\n- Template-first approach: Build robust templates before complex generation logic\n- Alpha developed in later phase after Standards Aligner proven\n- User provides

It streamlines all aspects of teaching work - from lesson planning to behavior documentation to data analysis - allowing educators to focus more on students and less on paperwork.\n\nThe module solves the critical problem of **teacher administrative burden**. Teachers spend countless hours on lesson planning, behavior documentation, progress reports, and administrative paperwork - time that could be better spent with students. TeachFlow automates and streamlines these tasks while maintaining professional quality and educational rigor.\n\nWhat makes TeachFlow exciting is its **intelligent delegation model**: core teaching agents can automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating efficient collaborative workflows that mirror how teaching teams actually work in schools.\n\n**Module Category:** Domain-Specific (Education)\n**Complexity Level:** Standard (moderate integrations, delegation patterns)\n**Target Users:** K-12 Teachers (all subjects, science focus initially)\n\n---\n\n## Module Identity\n\n### Core Concept\n\nTeachFlow is a comprehensive teaching workflow automation system that transforms the way educators manage their professional responsibilities. By combining specialized AI agents with intelligent workflow automation, it creates a digital teaching support team that handles the administrative burden while maintaining pedagogical excellence.\n\n### Unique Value Proposition\n\nWhat makes this module special:\n- **3-Dimensional Learning Framework**: Integrated NGSS 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC) ensures lessons aren't just standards-aligned but pedagogically sound. Instructional Designer builds lessons around all three dimensions, and Alpha provides student support scoped precisely to lesson objectives - preventing over-teaching or under-teaching.\n- **Intelligent Agent Delegation**: Core agents automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating collaborative workflows\n- **Domain Expertise**: Built specifically for K-12 education with deep understanding of teaching workflows, standards, and documentation requirements\n- **Complete Coverage**: Handles all teaching responsibilities - instruction, behavior, administration, and data analysis\n- **Professional Quality**: Generates standards-aligned, professionally formatted outputs ready for immediate use\n- **Time Multiplier**: Converts hours of administrative work into minutes of guided interaction\n\n### Personality Theme\n\n**\"The Professional Teaching Team\"** - Each agent embodies a different teaching specialist role with professional, supportive personalities:\n- Instructional Designer: Pedagogically sound, creative, student-centered\n- Behavior Specialist: Empathetic yet objective, solution-focused\n- Professional Writer: Formal, clear, administratively savvy\n- Data Analyst: Evidence-driven, insightful, action-oriented\n- Supporting specialists: Each brings focused expertise with collaborative spirit\n\nThe team maintains a consistent professional yet approachable tone, understanding the pressures teachers face while delivering high-quality solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Agent Architecture\n\nTeachFlow employs a **10-agent architecture** (5 core + 5 supporting) with a hierarchical delegation model. Five core agents handle primary teaching and student responsibilities and can delegate to five specialized supporting agents.\n\n### Agent Roster\n\n**CORE AGENTS (5)**\n\n**1.

Student Support Session** (Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Provide 3D-scoped guided learning support to students\n- **Input**: Lesson driving question OR topic, what student is stuck on, what they've tried\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Driving question identification** (\"What's your lesson's driving question?\")\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve 3D scope (SEP skill, DCI concept, CCC thinking pattern)\n  3. Personality selection (Socratic Guide / Study Buddy / Expert Tutor)\n  4. **3D-scoped teaching interaction**:\n     - Focus on lesson's DCI (concept scope)\n     - Practice lesson's SEP (skill development)\n     - Apply lesson's CCC (thinking pattern)\n     - Use worked examples of SIMILAR problems (not homework answers)\n  5. Understanding check (can student explain/apply?)\n  6. Resource provision (practice materials, study guides)\n- **Output**: Student understanding aligned to lesson scope + practice materials + progress tracking\n- **Complexity**: Complex (multi-personality, 3D scoping, safety-critical)\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures student help precisely matches what teacher taught - prevents confusion from scope mismatch\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n**Scenario: Daily Lesson Planning (Middle School Science Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a middle school science teacher, I want to create a detailed lesson plan for photosynthesis that includes hands-on activities, formative assessments, and differentiation for my IEP students, so that I can deliver engaging, standards-aligned instruction in 45 minutes of prep time instead of 2+ hours.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Now let me ask YOU a question...\"\n- **Behavior Specialist**: Has a gentle sense of humor about kid behavior while staying professional\n- **Data Analyst**: Gets genuinely excited about positive trends (\"Look at that growth curve!\")\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n**Hidden Commands:**\n- `/science-joke` (Alpha only): Shares age-appropriate science jokes related to current topic\n- `/why-3d` (any agent): Explains why 3D learning matters in student-friendly language\n- `/teacher-mode` (Alpha): Shows what the teacher's lesson plan looks like (transparency feature)\n\n**Unexpected Helpful Features:**\n- **Smart Context Awareness**: If Alpha notices a student struggling with a prerequisite concept, suggests: \"I notice this builds on [earlier topic]. Want a quick refresher first?\"\n- **Misconception Detection**: Alpha recognizes common misconceptions and gently corrects: \"Lots of students think that! Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1. Build Standards Aligner first and validate thoroughly\n2. Test 3D integration with Instructional Designer before Alpha\n3. Build supporting agents as simple MVPs, enhance later\n4. **Implement QA/Validation Agent** for automated quality checking\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n1. No agent/workflow moves to next phase without testing\n2. **QA Agent validates all outputs** before marking complete\n3. Alpha requires external safety review before release\n4. 3D lesson quality verified by external educator review\n\n**Scope Management:**\n1. MVP: Middle school NGSS science only\n2. \"No\" to features outside roadmap until Phase 5\n3. Document requested features for v2.0\n\n**Communication:**\n1. Clear documentation of what's in scope vs future\n2. Transparent about 3D framework learning curve\n3.

Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Now let me ask YOU a question...\"\n- **Behavior Specialist**: Has a gentle sense of humor about kid behavior while staying professional\n- **Data Analyst**: Gets genuinely excited about positive trends (\"Look at that growth curve!\")\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n**Hidden Commands:**\n- `/science-joke` (Alpha only): Shares age-appropriate science jokes related to current topic\n- `/why-3d` (any agent): Explains why 3D learning matters in student-friendly language\n- `/teacher-mode` (Alpha): Shows what the teacher's lesson plan looks like (transparency feature)\n\n**Unexpected Helpful Features:**\n- **Smart Context Awareness**: If Alpha notices a student struggling with a prerequisite concept, suggests: \"I notice this builds on [earlier topic]. Want a quick refresher first?\"\n- **Misconception Detection**: Alpha recognizes common misconceptions and gently corrects: \"Lots of students think that! Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1. Build Standards Aligner first and validate thoroughly\n2. Test 3D integration with Instructional Designer before Alpha\n3. Build supporting agents as simple MVPs, enhance later\n4. **Implement QA/Validation Agent** for automated quality checking\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n1. No agent/workflow moves to next phase without testing\n2. **QA Agent validates all outputs** before marking complete\n3. Alpha requires external safety review before release\n4. 3D lesson quality verified by external educator review\n\n**Scope Management:**\n1. MVP: Middle school NGSS science only\n2. \"No\" to features outside roadmap until Phase 5\n3. Document requested features for v2.0\n\n**Communication:**\n1. Clear documentation of what's in scope vs future\n2. Transparent about 3D framework learning curve\n3.

Build after Standards Aligner proven reliable and Instructional Designer validates 3D integration patterns.\n\n### Phase 5: Enhancement & Polish\n\n**Timeline:** Week 13-16 (8-12 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟢 ENHANCEMENT - Nice-to-haves and optimization\n\n**Components:**\n14. **Additional Workflows** (4-6 hours):\n    - Assessment Creation\n    - Differentiation Strategies\n    - Student Goal Setting\n    - Classroom Management Plans\n    - Parent Communication Templates\n\n15. **Template Library Expansion** (2-3 hours)\n16. **Documentation & Examples** (2-3 hours)\n17. **Performance Optimization** (Variable)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Complete 9-workflow portfolio\n- ✅ Comprehensive template library\n- ✅ User documentation and examples\n- ✅ Performance tuning complete\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n**\"Teaching Team\" Easter Eggs:**\n- Agents occasionally reference each other in helpful ways: \"Let me check with our Resource Curator...\" or \"The Behavior Specialist would love this approach to classroom management\"\n- When multiple agents are used in a session, they \"remember\" what the others did and build on it\n- Hidden `/team` command shows all agents in a fun \"staff directory\" format\n\n**3D Learning Celebrations:**\n- When a lesson hits all three dimensions beautifully, Instructional Designer adds a subtle \"🌟 3D Complete\" badge\n- Alpha celebrates when students successfully apply all three dimensions: \"You just used the SEP, explained the DCI, AND applied the CCC - that's the full 3D trifecta!\"\n\n**Personality Quirks:**\n- **Alpha's Study Buddy mode**: Uses age-appropriate enthusiasm (\"Okay let's tackle this!\") and encouraging phrases middle schoolers actually use\n- **Alpha's Socratic Guide**: Occasionally says \"Good question! Now let me ask YOU a question...\"\n- **Behavior Specialist**: Has a gentle sense of humor about kid behavior while staying professional\n- **Data Analyst**: Gets genuinely excited about positive trends (\"Look at that growth curve!\")\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n**Hidden Commands:**\n- `/science-joke` (Alpha only): Shares age-appropriate science jokes related to current topic\n- `/why-3d` (any agent): Explains why 3D learning matters in student-friendly language\n- `/teacher-mode` (Alpha): Shows what the teacher's lesson plan looks like (transparency feature)\n\n**Unexpected Helpful Features:**\n- **Smart Context Awareness**: If Alpha notices a student struggling with a prerequisite concept, suggests: \"I notice this builds on [earlier topic]. Want a quick refresher first?\"\n- **Misconception Detection**: Alpha recognizes common misconceptions and gently corrects: \"Lots of students think that! Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1. Build Standards Aligner first and validate thoroughly\n2. Test 3D integration with Instructional Designer before Alpha\n3. Build supporting agents as simple MVPs, enhance later\n4. **Implement QA/Validation Agent** for automated quality checking\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n1. No agent/workflow moves to next phase without testing\n2. **QA Agent validates all outputs** before marking complete\n3. Alpha requires external safety review before release\n4. 3D lesson quality verified by external educator review\n\n**Scope Management:**\n1. MVP: Middle school NGSS science only\n2. \"No\" to features outside roadmap until Phase 5\n3. Document requested features for v2.0\n\n**Communication:**\n1. Clear documentation of what's in scope vs future\n2. Transparent about 3D framework learning curve\n3.

Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Must be built first and proven reliable.\n\n### Phase 2: Core Teaching Tools (MVP)\n\n**Timeline:** Week 3-5 (12-16 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - High-impact teacher-facing tools\n\n**Components:**\n3. **Instructional Designer Agent** (4-5 hours)\n   - Professional, pedagogically-sound personality\n   - Integration with Standards Aligner for 3D components\n   - Delegation to supporting agents\n\n4. **Lesson Plan Builder Workflow** (5-6 hours)\n   - 3D-informed lesson planning workflow\n   - Interactive planning with Standards Aligner delegation\n   - Template with 3D components prominently featured\n   - Test with multiple standards to verify 3D integration\n\n5. **Behavior Specialist Agent** (3-4 hours)\n   - Empathetic yet objective personality\n   - Parent communication expertise\n\n6. **Behavior Incident Report Workflow** (3-4 hours)\n   - Interview-style data collection\n   - Dual output (parent email + incident report)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ 2 core teacher-facing agents operational\n- ✅ 2 high-impact workflows functional\n- ✅ 3D-informed lessons validated by external review\n- ✅ Templates library started\n\n**Rationale:** These are highest-impact teacher tools. Building Instructional Designer validates Standards Aligner integration before more complex Alpha.\n\n### Phase 3: Analytics & Supporting Cast\n\n**Timeline:** Week 6-8 (10-14 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟡 IMPORTANT - Completes core teaching suite\n\n**Components:**\n7. **Data Analyst Agent** (3-4 hours)\n8. **Progress Report Generator Workflow** (4-5 hours)\n9. **Professional Writer Agent** (2-3 hours)\n10. **Supporting Agents** (3-4 hours total):\n    - Resource Curator\n    - Accommodation Specialist\n    - Artifact Generator\n    - Goal Tracker\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Complete set of 4 core teacher agents\n- ✅ 3 core workflows operational\n- ✅ 4 supporting agents enabling delegation\n- ✅ Delegation patterns tested and optimized\n\n### Phase 4: Student Support System (Advanced)\n\n**Timeline:** Week 9-12 (16-20 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟡 IMPORTANT - Complex but high-value student-facing agent\n\n**Components:**\n11. **Alpha - Student Support Agent** (8-10 hours)\n    - Triple personality system (Socratic Guide, Study Buddy, Expert Tutor)\n    - Driving question-based lesson identification\n    - 3D-scoped teaching logic\n    - Academic integrity protection\n    - Safety and age-appropriateness features\n\n12. **Student Support Session Workflow** (6-8 hours)\n    - Driving question intake\n    - Standards Aligner integration for 3D scope\n    - Personality-adapted teaching\n    - Understanding validation\n    - Resource delegation\n\n13. **Safety & Testing** (2-3 hours)\n    - Academic integrity testing (verify no direct answers)\n    - Age-appropriateness validation\n    - 3D scope adherence testing\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Alpha agent fully operational with all 3 personalities\n- ✅ Student Support Session workflow tested with real scenarios\n- ✅ Safety validated (no homework answers, appropriate content)\n- ✅ 95%+ 3D scope alignment verified\n\n**Rationale:** Alpha is most complex agent (multi-personality, student-facing, safety-critical). Build after Standards Aligner proven reliable and Instructional Designer validates 3D integration patterns.\n\n### Phase 5: Enhancement & Polish\n\n**Timeline:** Week 13-16 (8-12 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟢 ENHANCEMENT - Nice-to-haves and optimization\n\n**Components:**\n14. **Additional Workflows** (4-6 hours):\n    - Assessment Creation\n    - Differentiation Strategies\n    - Student Goal Setting\n    - Classroom Management Plans\n    - Parent Communication Templates\n\n15. **Template Library Expansion** (2-3 hours)\n16. **Documentation & Examples** (2-3 hours)\n17. **Performance Optimization** (Variable)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Complete 9-workflow portfolio\n- ✅ Comprehensive template library\n- ✅ User documentation and examples\n- ✅ Performance tuning complete\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n**\"Teaching Team\" Easter Eggs:**\n- Agents occasionally reference each other in helpful ways: \"Let me check with our Resource Curator...\" or \"The Behavior Specialist would love this approach to classroom management\"\n- When multiple agents are used in a session, they \"remember\" what the others did and build on it\n- Hidden `/team` command shows all agents in a fun \"staff directory\" format\n\n**3D Learning Celebrations:**\n- When a lesson hits all three dimensions beautifully, Instructional Designer adds a subtle \"🌟 3D Complete\" badge\n- Alpha celebrates when students successfully apply all three dimensions: \"You just used the SEP, explained the DCI, AND applied the CCC - that's the full 3D trifecta!\"\n\n**Personality Quirks:**\n- **Alpha's Study Buddy mode**: Uses age-appropriate enthusiasm (\"Okay let's tackle this!\") and encouraging phrases middle schoolers actually use\n- **Alpha's Socratic Guide**: Occasionally says \"Good question! Now let me ask YOU a question...\"\n- **Behavior Specialist**: Has a gentle sense of humor about kid behavior while staying professional\n- **Data Analyst**: Gets genuinely excited about positive trends (\"Look at that growth curve!\")\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n**Hidden Commands:**\n- `/science-joke` (Alpha only): Shares age-appropriate science jokes related to current topic\n- `/why-3d` (any agent): Explains why 3D learning matters in student-friendly language\n- `/teacher-mode` (Alpha): Shows what the teacher's lesson plan looks like (transparency feature)\n\n**Unexpected Helpful Features:**\n- **Smart Context Awareness**: If Alpha notices a student struggling with a prerequisite concept, suggests: \"I notice this builds on [earlier topic]. Want a quick refresher first?\"\n- **Misconception Detection**: Alpha recognizes common misconceptions and gently corrects: \"Lots of students think that! Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1. Build Standards Aligner first and validate thoroughly\n2. Test 3D integration with Instructional Designer before Alpha\n3. Build supporting agents as simple MVPs, enhance later\n4. **Implement QA/Validation Agent** for automated quality checking\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n1. No agent/workflow moves to next phase without testing\n2. **QA Agent validates all outputs** before marking complete\n3. Alpha requires external safety review before release\n4. 3D lesson quality verified by external educator review\n\n**Scope Management:**\n1. MVP: Middle school NGSS science only\n2. \"No\" to features outside roadmap until Phase 5\n3. Document requested features for v2.0\n\n**Communication:**\n1. Clear documentation of what's in scope vs future\n2. Transparent about 3D framework learning curve\n3.

Now let me ask YOU a question...\"\n- **Behavior Specialist**: Has a gentle sense of humor about kid behavior while staying professional\n- **Data Analyst**: Gets genuinely excited about positive trends (\"Look at that growth curve!\")\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n**Hidden Commands:**\n- `/science-joke` (Alpha only): Shares age-appropriate science jokes related to current topic\n- `/why-3d` (any agent): Explains why 3D learning matters in student-friendly language\n- `/teacher-mode` (Alpha): Shows what the teacher's lesson plan looks like (transparency feature)\n\n**Unexpected Helpful Features:**\n- **Smart Context Awareness**: If Alpha notices a student struggling with a prerequisite concept, suggests: \"I notice this builds on [earlier topic]. Want a quick refresher first?\"\n- **Misconception Detection**: Alpha recognizes common misconceptions and gently corrects: \"Lots of students think that! Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1.

Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Data needs to be structured in this format.\n\n**Normalization Strategy for Driving Questions**:\n- Lowercase all text\n- Remove punctuation\n- Stem to core question (e.g., \"How do plants get energy?\" and \"How do plants get the energy they need?\" both map to same lesson)\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n**Storage Needs** (all local, no cloud):\n- **3D Standards Database**: NGSS (priority), Common Core ELA/Math, state standards (structured as above)\n- **Templates**: Lesson plan templates, assessment formats, communication templates, study guide formats\n- **Student Profiles** (on-demand): Anonymous learning profiles created as needed for differentiation, goal tracking\n- **Usage Analytics**: Workflow usage patterns, agent delegation frequency (for optimization)\n\n**Data Sources**:\n- NGSS standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- Common Core standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- User-created templates and customizations\n- Session data for Goal Tracker and progress monitoring\n- **No PII storage** (all data local only)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal BMAD Modules**:\n- Potentially integrate with other education-focused BMAD modules (if developed)\n- Share template library across education modules\n\n**External Tools/Platforms** (future):\n- **LMS Integration**: Export lesson plans to Canvas, Google Classroom,

reports), Word/Google Docs (editable documents), CSV (data exports)\n- **Import**: CSV (student data for analytics), Standards files (JSON)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n**BMAD Framework Dependencies**:\n- Core BMAD system for agent/workflow execution\n- Template system for document generation\n- Delegation framework for agent-to-agent communication\n\n**External Dependencies**:\n- None required for MVP\n- Optional: Web search for Resource Curator\n- Optional: Standards database APIs (alternative to local storage)\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n**Complexity Level: Standard → Moderate** (elevated due to 3D Learning integration)\n\n**Moderate Complexity Elements**:\n- Agent delegation system (core agents → supporting agents)\n- Multi-personality mode for Alpha (3 distinct interaction styles)\n- Template-based document generation across multiple formats\n- **3D Learning data structure** (dual-index, normalization, scope provision)\n- **Standards Aligner intelligence** (driving question matching, 3D component provision)\n\n**Low Complexity Elements**:\n- Individual agent personalities (well-defined roles)\n- Interview-style workflows (guided Q&A)\n- Static template rendering\n\n**High Complexity Elements**:\n- **Alpha agent**: Student-facing with safety requirements, academic integrity detection, emotional intelligence, **3D-scoped teaching precision**\n- **Standards Aligner**: Comprehensive standards database, driving question normalization, 3D component correlation\n\n**Mitigation Strategies**:\n- Phased development: Build Standards Aligner in Phase 1 (before dependent agents)\n- Template-first approach: Build robust templates before complex generation logic\n- Alpha developed in later phase after Standards Aligner proven\n- User provides standards data (reduces data collection complexity)\n- Start with NGSS middle school only (narrower scope for MVP)\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the

Build after Standards Aligner proven reliable and Instructional Designer validates 3D integration patterns.\n\n### Phase 5: Enhancement & Polish\n\n**Timeline:** Week 13-16 (8-12 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟢 ENHANCEMENT - Nice-to-haves and optimization\n\n**Components:**\n14. **Additional Workflows** (4-6 hours):\n    - Assessment Creation\n    - Differentiation Strategies\n    - Student Goal Setting\n    - Classroom Management Plans\n    - Parent Communication Templates\n\n15. **Template Library Expansion** (2-3 hours)\n16. **Documentation & Examples** (2-3 hours)\n17. **Performance Optimization** (Variable)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Complete 9-workflow portfolio\n- ✅ Comprehensive template library\n- ✅ User documentation and examples\n- ✅ Performance tuning complete\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n**\"Teaching Team\" Easter Eggs:**\n- Agents occasionally reference each other in helpful ways: \"Let me check with our Resource Curator...\" or \"The Behavior Specialist would love this approach to classroom management\"\n- When multiple agents are used in a session, they \"remember\" what the others did and build on it\n- Hidden `/team` command shows all agents in a fun \"staff directory\" format\n\n**3D Learning Celebrations:**\n- When a lesson hits all three dimensions beautifully, Instructional Designer adds a subtle \"🌟 3D Complete\" badge\n- Alpha celebrates when students successfully apply all three dimensions: \"You just used the SEP, explained the DCI, AND applied the CCC - that's the full 3D trifecta!\"\n\n**Personality Quirks:**\n- **Alpha's Study Buddy mode**: Uses age-appropriate enthusiasm (\"Okay let's tackle this!\") and encouraging phrases middle schoolers actually use\n- **Alpha's Socratic Guide**: Occasionally says \"Good question! Now let me ask YOU a question...\"\n- **Behavior Specialist**: Has a gentle sense of humor about kid behavior while staying professional\n- **Data Analyst**: Gets genuinely excited about positive trends (\"Look at that growth curve!\")\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n**Hidden Commands:**\n- `/science-joke` (Alpha only): Shares age-appropriate science jokes related to current topic\n- `/why-3d` (any agent): Explains why 3D learning matters in student-friendly language\n- `/teacher-mode` (Alpha): Shows what the teacher's lesson plan looks like (transparency feature)\n\n**Unexpected Helpful Features:**\n- **Smart Context Awareness**: If Alpha notices a student struggling with a prerequisite concept, suggests: \"I notice this builds on [earlier topic]. Want a quick refresher first?\"\n- **Misconception Detection**: Alpha recognizes common misconceptions and gently corrects: \"Lots of students think that! Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1. Build Standards Aligner first and validate thoroughly\n2. Test 3D integration with Instructional Designer before Alpha\n3. Build supporting agents as simple MVPs, enhance later\n4. **Implement QA/Validation Agent** for automated quality checking\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n1. No agent/workflow moves to next phase without testing\n2. **QA Agent validates all outputs** before marking complete\n3. Alpha requires external safety review before release\n4. 3D lesson quality verified by external educator review\n\n**Scope Management:**\n1. MVP: Middle school NGSS science only\n2. \"No\" to features outside roadmap until Phase 5\n3. Document requested features for v2.0\n\n**Communication:**\n1. Clear documentation of what's in scope vs future\n2. Transparent about 3D framework learning curve\n3. Regular user feedback loops\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. **Phase 1 MUST complete before anything else**: 3D Standards Database + Standards Aligner agent are architectural foundation\n2. **Validate 3D integration with Instructional Designer before building Alpha**: Prove the pattern works with simpler agent first\n3. **QA/Validation Agent in Phase 2**: Establish quality gates early to catch issues during development, not after\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n**3-Dimensional Learning as Core Architecture:**\n- Decision: Make NGSS 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC) a first-class citizen in data structure and agent logic\n- Rationale: Differentiates TeachFlow from generic lesson planners; ensures pedagogical soundness\n- Impact: Standards Aligner becomes critical infrastructure; all lesson planning flows through 3D framework\n\n**Driving Question as Primary Student Entry Point:**\n- Decision: Use lesson driving questions (not topics) for Alpha to identify lesson scope\n- Rationale: Students remember driving questions better than generic topics; maps precisely to standards\n- Impact: Requires dual-index database; better lesson scoping for student support\n\n**Alpha as Separate Core Agent (not workflow):**\n- Decision: Make student support a full agent with personality, not just a workflow\n- Rationale: Complexity (3 personalities, safety, 3D scoping) warrants agent-level design\n- Impact: Higher development effort but much better student experience\n\n**Local-Only Data Storage:**\n- Decision: All data (standards, profiles, templates) stored locally, no cloud\n- Rationale: Privacy, teacher control, no PII concerns, works offline\n- Impact: Simpler architecture, no backend infrastructure needed\n\n**QA/Validation Agent as Quality Gatekeeper:**\n- Decision: Dedicated agent for quality assurance rather than manual testing\n- Rationale: Automated validation catches issues faster; establishes consistent quality standards\n- Impact: Higher confidence in outputs; reduces manual testing burden\n\n### Open Questions\n\n**Standards Data Collection:**\n- Q: Will user (Frank) provide NGSS data in structured format or raw documents?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 1 Week 1\n- Impact: Data structuring effort estimate\n\n**Alpha Personality Implementation:**\n- Q: Should personalities be separate prompt templates or dynamic prompt engineering?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 4 planning\n- Impact: Complexity and maintainability trade-off\n\n**QA Agent Automation Level:**\n- Q: What percentage of validation can be automated vs requiring human review?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 2 during QA Agent development\n- Impact: Teacher effort for validation\n\n**Standards Coverage Scope:**\n- Q: Focus only on most common standards for MVP, or attempt comprehensive coverage?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 1 during database creation\n- Impact: Development timeline and initial usefulness\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n{{inspiration_sources}}\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n{{similar_modules}}\n\n### Technical References\n\n{{technical_references}}\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

total)\n\n**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - All subsequent phases depend on this\n\n**Components:**\n1. **3D Standards Database Creation** (4-6 hours)\n   - Structure NGSS middle school standards data (user-provided) in dual-index JSON format\n   - Create life science, physical science, earth/space science files\n   - Map driving questions to standards\n   - Document data schema and normalization rules\n\n2. **Standards Aligner Agent** (4-6 hours)\n   - Build critical infrastructure agent\n   - Implement driving question lookup (for Alpha)\n   - Implement standard code lookup (for Instructional Designer)\n   - 3D component provision (SEP, DCI, CCC)\n   - Test accuracy of driving question matching\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Complete NGSS middle school 3D standards database\n- ✅ Functional Standards Aligner agent\n- ✅ 99%+ lookup accuracy validated\n- ✅ Documentation for extending to other standards\n\n**Rationale:** Standards Aligner is architectural foundation - both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend on it for 3D components. Must be built first and proven reliable.\n\n### Phase 2: Core Teaching Tools (MVP)\n\n**Timeline:** Week 3-5 (12-16 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL - High-impact teacher-facing tools\n\n**Components:**\n3. **Instructional Designer Agent** (4-5 hours)\n   - Professional, pedagogically-sound personality\n   - Integration with Standards Aligner for 3D components\n   - Delegation to supporting agents\n\n4. **Lesson Plan Builder Workflow** (5-6 hours)\n   - 3D-informed lesson planning workflow\n   - Interactive planning with Standards Aligner delegation\n   - Template with 3D components prominently featured\n   - Test with multiple standards to verify 3D integration\n\n5. **Behavior Specialist Agent** (3-4 hours)\n   - Empathetic yet objective personality\n   - Parent communication expertise\n\n6. **Behavior Incident Report Workflow** (3-4 hours)\n   - Interview-style data collection\n   - Dual output (parent email + incident report)\n\n7. **QA/Validation Agent** (3-4 hours)\n   - Build automated validation rules (3D presence check, format compliance)\n   - Implement checklist-based validation for human review\n   - Create academic integrity detection patterns\n   - Test with Instructional Designer and Behavior Specialist outputs\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ 2 core teacher-facing agents operational\n- ✅ 2 high-impact workflows functional\n- ✅ QA/Validation Agent ensuring quality standards\n- ✅ 3D-informed lessons validated (automated + human review)\n- ✅ Templates library started\n\n**Rationale:** These are highest-impact teacher tools. Building Instructional Designer validates Standards Aligner integration before more complex Alpha. QA Agent built early to validate MVP outputs and establish quality gates.\n\n### Phase 3: Analytics & Supporting Cast\n\n**Timeline:** Week 6-8 (10-14 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟡 IMPORTANT - Completes core teaching suite\n\n**Components:**\n7. **Data Analyst Agent** (3-4 hours)\n8. **Progress Report Generator Workflow** (4-5 hours)\n9. **Professional Writer Agent** (2-3 hours)\n10. **Supporting Agents** (3-4 hours total):\n    - Resource Curator\n    - Accommodation Specialist\n    - Artifact Generator\n    - Goal Tracker\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Complete set of 4 core teacher agents\n- ✅ 3 core workflows operational\n- ✅ 4 supporting agents enabling delegation\n- ✅ Delegation patterns tested and optimized\n\n### Phase 4: Student Support System (Advanced)\n\n**Timeline:** Week 9-12 (16-20 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟡 IMPORTANT - Complex but high-value student-facing agent\n\n**Components:**\n11. **Alpha - Student Support Agent** (8-10 hours)\n    - Triple personality system (Socratic Guide, Study Buddy, Expert Tutor)\n    - Driving question-based lesson identification\n    - 3D-scoped teaching logic\n    - Academic integrity protection\n    - Safety and age-appropriateness features\n\n12. **Student Support Session Workflow** (6-8 hours)\n    - Driving question intake\n    - Standards Aligner integration for 3D scope\n    - Personality-adapted teaching\n    - Understanding validation\n    - Resource delegation\n\n13. **Safety & Testing** (2-3 hours)\n    - Academic integrity testing (verify no direct answers)\n    - Age-appropriateness validation\n    - 3D scope adherence testing\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Alpha agent fully operational with all 3 personalities\n- ✅ Student Support Session workflow tested with real scenarios\n- ✅ Safety validated (no homework answers, appropriate content)\n- ✅ 95%+ 3D scope alignment verified\n\n**Rationale:** Alpha is most complex agent (multi-personality, student-facing, safety-critical). Build after Standards Aligner proven reliable and Instructional Designer validates 3D integration patterns.\n\n### Phase 5: Enhancement & Polish\n\n**Timeline:** Week 13-16 (8-12 hours total)\n\n**Priority:** 🟢 ENHANCEMENT - Nice-to-haves and optimization\n\n**Components:**\n14. **Additional Workflows** (4-6 hours):\n    - Assessment Creation\n    - Differentiation Strategies\n    - Student Goal Setting\n    - Classroom Management Plans\n    - Parent Communication Templates\n\n15. **Template Library Expansion** (2-3 hours)\n16. **Documentation & Examples** (2-3 hours)\n17. **Performance Optimization** (Variable)\n\n**Deliverables:**\n- ✅ Complete 9-workflow portfolio\n- ✅ Comprehensive template library\n- ✅ User documentation and examples\n- ✅ Performance tuning complete\n\n---\n\n## Creative Features\n\n### Special Touches\n\n**\"Teaching Team\" Easter Eggs:**\n- Agents occasionally reference each other in helpful ways: \"Let me check with our Resource Curator...\" or \"The Behavior Specialist would love this approach to classroom management\"\n- When multiple agents are used in a session, they \"remember\" what the others did and build on it\n- Hidden `/team` command shows all agents in a fun \"staff directory\" format\n\n**3D Learning Celebrations:**\n- When a lesson hits all three dimensions beautifully, Instructional Designer adds a subtle \"🌟 3D Complete\" badge\n- Alpha celebrates when students successfully apply all three dimensions: \"You just used the SEP, explained the DCI, AND applied the CCC - that's the full 3D trifecta!\"\n\n**Personality Quirks:**\n- **Alpha's Study Buddy mode**: Uses age-appropriate enthusiasm (\"Okay let's tackle this!\") and encouraging phrases middle schoolers actually use\n- **Alpha's Socratic Guide**: Occasionally says \"Good question! Now let me ask YOU a question...\"\n- **Behavior Specialist**: Has a gentle sense of humor about kid behavior while staying professional\n- **Data Analyst**: Gets genuinely excited about positive trends (\"Look at that growth curve!\")\n\n### Easter Eggs and Delighters\n\n**Hidden Commands:**\n- `/science-joke` (Alpha only): Shares age-appropriate science jokes related to current topic\n- `/why-3d` (any agent): Explains why 3D learning matters in student-friendly language\n- `/teacher-mode` (Alpha): Shows what the teacher's lesson plan looks like (transparency feature)\n\n**Unexpected Helpful Features:**\n- **Smart Context Awareness**: If Alpha notices a student struggling with a prerequisite concept, suggests: \"I notice this builds on [earlier topic]. Want a quick refresher first?\"\n- **Misconception Detection**: Alpha recognizes common misconceptions and gently corrects: \"Lots of students think that! Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1. Build Standards Aligner first and validate thoroughly\n2. Test 3D integration with Instructional Designer before Alpha\n3. Build supporting agents as simple MVPs, enhance later\n4. **Implement QA/Validation Agent** for automated quality checking\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n1. No agent/workflow moves to next phase without testing\n2. **QA Agent validates all outputs** before marking complete\n3. Alpha requires external safety review before release\n4. 3D lesson quality verified by external educator review\n\n**Scope Management:**\n1. MVP: Middle school NGSS science only\n2. \"No\" to features outside roadmap until Phase 5\n3. Document requested features for v2.0\n\n**Communication:**\n1. Clear documentation of what's in scope vs future\n2. Transparent about 3D framework learning curve\n3. Regular user feedback loops\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. **Phase 1 MUST complete before anything else**: 3D Standards Database + Standards Aligner agent are architectural foundation\n2. **Validate 3D integration with Instructional Designer before building Alpha**: Prove the pattern works with simpler agent first\n3. **QA/Validation Agent in Phase 2**: Establish quality gates early to catch issues during development, not after\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n**3-Dimensional Learning as Core Architecture:**\n- Decision: Make NGSS 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC) a first-class citizen in data structure and agent logic\n- Rationale: Differentiates TeachFlow from generic lesson planners; ensures pedagogical soundness\n- Impact: Standards Aligner becomes critical infrastructure; all lesson planning flows through 3D framework\n\n**Driving Question as Primary Student Entry Point:**\n- Decision: Use lesson driving questions (not topics) for Alpha to identify lesson scope\n- Rationale: Students remember driving questions better than generic topics; maps precisely to standards\n- Impact: Requires dual-index database; better lesson scoping for student support\n\n**Alpha as Separate Core Agent (not workflow):**\n- Decision: Make student support a full agent with personality, not just a workflow\n- Rationale: Complexity (3 personalities, safety, 3D scoping) warrants agent-level design\n- Impact: Higher development effort but much better student experience\n\n**Local-Only Data Storage:**\n- Decision: All data (standards, profiles, templates) stored locally, no cloud\n- Rationale: Privacy, teacher control, no PII concerns, works offline\n- Impact: Simpler architecture, no backend infrastructure needed\n\n**QA/Validation Agent as Quality Gatekeeper:**\n- Decision: Dedicated agent for quality assurance rather than manual testing\n- Rationale: Automated validation catches issues faster; establishes consistent quality standards\n- Impact: Higher confidence in outputs; reduces manual testing burden\n\n### Open Questions\n\n**Standards Data Collection:**\n- Q: Will user (Frank) provide NGSS data in structured format or raw documents?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 1 Week 1\n- Impact: Data structuring effort estimate\n\n**Alpha Personality Implementation:**\n- Q: Should personalities be separate prompt templates or dynamic prompt engineering?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 4 planning\n- Impact: Complexity and maintainability trade-off\n\n**QA Agent Automation Level:**\n- Q: What percentage of validation can be automated vs requiring human review?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 2 during QA Agent development\n- Impact: Teacher effort for validation\n\n**Standards Coverage Scope:**\n- Q: Focus only on most common standards for MVP, or attempt comprehensive coverage?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 1 during database creation\n- Impact: Development timeline and initial usefulness\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n**NGSS Framework:**\n- Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) official documentation\n- 3-Dimensional Learning research and best practices\n- NGSS Appendix F: Science and Engineering Practices\n- NGSS Appendix G: Crosscutting Concepts\n\n**Pedagogical Research:**\n- Understanding by Design (backward design framework)\n- Culturally Responsive Teaching practices\n- Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles\n- Growth mindset research (Carol Dweck)\n\n**AI Tutoring Research:**\n- Socratic questioning techniques for learning\n- Adaptive learning personality systems\n- Academic integrity in AI tutoring\n- Middle school developmental psychology\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n**Within BMAD:**\n- BMM (BMAD Method Manager) - Module structure patterns\n- CIS (Claude Instruction Studio) - Agent design patterns\n\n**External Tools** (for competitive analysis):\n- Generic lesson planner tools (lack 3D integration)\n- AI homework helpers (lack lesson scoping)\n- Standards alignment tools (lack workflow automation)\n\n**Key Differentiators:**\n- TeachFlow integrates 3D learning at architecture level\n- Driving question-based student support scoping\n- Complete teaching workflow coverage (instruction + behavior + data)\n\n### Technical References\n\n**BMAD Framework:**\n- BMAD agent creation patterns\n- BMAD workflow execution engine\n- BMAD delegation system\n- BMAD template system\n\n**Data Formats:**\n- JSON for standards database (dual-index structure)\n- Markdown for templates\n- YAML for agent/workflow configuration\n\n**Educational Standards:**\n- NGSS middle school standards documentation\n- Common Core State Standards (ELA & Math)\n- State-specific standards frameworks\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.

It streamlines all aspects of teaching work - from lesson planning to behavior documentation to data analysis - allowing educators to focus more on students and less on paperwork.\n\nThe module solves the critical problem of **teacher administrative burden**. Teachers spend countless hours on lesson planning, behavior documentation, progress reports, and administrative paperwork - time that could be better spent with students. TeachFlow automates and streamlines these tasks while maintaining professional quality and educational rigor.\n\nWhat makes TeachFlow exciting is its **intelligent delegation model**: core teaching agents can automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating efficient collaborative workflows that mirror how teaching teams actually work in schools.\n\n**Module Category:** Domain-Specific (Education)\n**Complexity Level:** Standard (moderate integrations, delegation patterns)\n**Target Users:** K-12 Teachers (all subjects, science focus initially)\n\n---\n\n## Module Identity\n\n### Core Concept\n\nTeachFlow is a comprehensive teaching workflow automation system that transforms the way educators manage their professional responsibilities. By combining specialized AI agents with intelligent workflow automation, it creates a digital teaching support team that handles the administrative burden while maintaining pedagogical excellence.\n\n### Unique Value Proposition\n\nWhat makes this module special:\n- **3-Dimensional Learning Framework**: Integrated NGSS 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC) ensures lessons aren't just standards-aligned but pedagogically sound. Instructional Designer builds lessons around all three dimensions, and Alpha provides student support scoped precisely to lesson objectives - preventing over-teaching or under-teaching.\n- **Intelligent Agent Delegation**: Core agents automatically delegate to specialized supporting agents, creating collaborative workflows\n- **Domain Expertise**: Built specifically for K-12 education with deep understanding of teaching workflows, standards, and documentation requirements\n- **Complete Coverage**: Handles all teaching responsibilities - instruction, behavior, administration, and data analysis\n- **Professional Quality**: Generates standards-aligned, professionally formatted outputs ready for immediate use\n- **Time Multiplier**: Converts hours of administrative work into minutes of guided interaction\n\n### Personality Theme\n\n**\"The Professional Teaching Team\"** - Each agent embodies a different teaching specialist role with professional, supportive personalities:\n- Instructional Designer: Pedagogically sound, creative, student-centered\n- Behavior Specialist: Empathetic yet objective, solution-focused\n- Professional Writer: Formal, clear, administratively savvy\n- Data Analyst: Evidence-driven, insightful, action-oriented\n- Supporting specialists: Each brings focused expertise with collaborative spirit\n\nThe team maintains a consistent professional yet approachable tone, understanding the pressures teachers face while delivering high-quality solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Agent Architecture\n\nTeachFlow employs an **11-agent architecture** (5 core + 6 supporting) with a hierarchical delegation model. Five core agents handle primary teaching and student responsibilities and can delegate to six specialized supporting agents.\n\n### Agent Roster\n\n**CORE AGENTS (5)**\n\n**1.

Teacher interacts with core agent (Instructional Designer, Behavior Specialist, etc.)\n2. Core agent assesses task complexity\n3. If specialized support needed, delegates to supporting agent(s)\n4. Supporting agents complete subtasks\n5. Core agent integrates results and delivers to teacher\n\n*Student-Focused Workflow (Alpha):*\n1. Student loads Alpha directly OR teacher delegates to Alpha for student materials\n2. Alpha selects/confirms personality mode with student\n3. Alpha provides guided learning (never direct answers)\n4. Alpha delegates to supporting agents for resources/materials as needed\n5. Alpha tracks student progress and provides encouragement\n\nThis mirrors how teaching professionals actually collaborate in schools - lead teachers working with specialists to deliver comprehensive student support, with students also having direct access to learning assistance.\n\n---\n\n## Workflow Ecosystem\n\nTeachFlow provides **9 comprehensive workflows** categorized by primary function and frequency of use.\n\n### Core Workflows\n\nEssential functionality that delivers primary value (most frequently used):\n\n**1. Lesson Plan Builder** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Create comprehensive, 3D-informed NGSS lesson plans\n- **Input**: Learning objectives, grade level, subject, time allocation\n- **Process**:\n  1. Interactive planning (gather lesson context)\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve standard code + 3D components (SEP, DCI, CCC)\n  3. **3D-informed activity sequencing** (activities must engage SEP, develop DCI, highlight CCC)\n  4. **3D-aligned assessment creation** (assess SEP performance, DCI understanding, CCC application)\n  5. Differentiation strategies\n- **Output**: Complete lesson plan with objectives, 3D-aligned activities, dimensional assessments, and materials list\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures every lesson engages all three dimensions of NGSS learning, not just content coverage\n\n**2.

Differentiation Strategies** (Instructional Designer)\n- **Purpose**: Adapt instruction for diverse learners\n- **Input**: Lesson content, student needs, learning profiles\n- **Process**: Needs analysis → strategy selection → modification design\n- **Output**: Differentiation plan with specific adaptations\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**6. Student Goal Setting** (Instructional Designer + Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Facilitate student goal-setting sessions\n- **Input**: Student current performance, target areas\n- **Process**: Goal identification → SMART criteria → action planning → monitoring setup\n- **Output**: Student goal-setting worksheet and tracking plan\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n**7. Classroom Management Plans** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Develop comprehensive classroom management strategies\n- **Input**: Grade level, class dynamics, challenges\n- **Process**: Assessment → strategy selection → procedure development → implementation planning\n- **Output**: Complete classroom management plan document\n- **Complexity**: Standard\n\n**8. Parent Communication Templates** (Behavior Specialist)\n- **Purpose**: Generate professional parent communications for various scenarios\n- **Input**: Communication purpose, context, tone preference\n- **Process**: Template selection → customization → tone adjustment → formatting\n- **Output**: Ready-to-send parent communication (email, letter, note)\n- **Complexity**: Simple\n\n### Utility Workflows\n\nSupporting operations specific to student learning (Alpha-specific):\n\n**9. Student Support Session** (Alpha)\n- **Purpose**: Provide 3D-scoped guided learning support to students\n- **Input**: Lesson driving question OR topic, what student is stuck on, what they've tried\n- **Process**:\n  1. **Driving question identification** (\"What's your lesson's driving question?\")\n  2. **Delegate to Standards Aligner** → retrieve 3D scope (SEP skill, DCI concept, CCC thinking pattern)\n  3. Personality selection (Socratic Guide / Study Buddy / Expert Tutor)\n  4. **3D-scoped teaching interaction**:\n     - Focus on lesson's DCI (concept scope)\n     - Practice lesson's SEP (skill development)\n     - Apply lesson's CCC (thinking pattern)\n     - Use worked examples of SIMILAR problems (not homework answers)\n  5. Understanding check (can student explain/apply?)\n  6. Resource provision (practice materials, study guides)\n- **Output**: Student understanding aligned to lesson scope + practice materials + progress tracking\n- **Complexity**: Complex (multi-personality, 3D scoping, safety-critical)\n- **3D Integration**: Ensures student help precisely matches what teacher taught - prevents confusion from scope mismatch\n\n---\n\n## User Scenarios\n\n### Primary Use Case\n\n**Scenario: Daily Lesson Planning (Middle School Science Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a middle school science teacher, I want to create a detailed lesson plan for photosynthesis that includes hands-on activities, formative assessments, and differentiation for my IEP students, so that I can deliver engaging, standards-aligned instruction in 45 minutes of prep time instead of 2+ hours.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Instructional Designer agent\n2. Runs `/plan` command (Lesson Plan Builder workflow)\n3. Answers guided questions: topic (photosynthesis), grade (7th), standards (NGSS), time (50 min period), student needs (3 IEP students)\n4. Instructional Designer delegates to:\n   - Standards Aligner → ensures NGSS alignment\n   - Accommodation Specialist → generates IEP modifications\n   - Resource Curator → finds age-appropriate lab activity materials\n   - Artifact Generator → creates middle-school-level graphic organizers\n5. Receives complete lesson plan with objectives, activities, assessments, differentiation strategies, and materials list\n6. This saves 75+ minutes and ensures professional-quality, standards-aligned instruction\n\n### Secondary Use Cases\n\n**Scenario 2: Behavior Incident Documentation (Middle School Teacher)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As a 7th grade teacher, I want to quickly document a classroom disruption and notify parents professionally, so that I can maintain clear communication and records without spending my entire planning period on one incident.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Teacher loads Behavior Specialist agent after incident occurs\n2. Runs `/incident` command (Behavior Incident Report workflow)\n3. Answers interview questions: student name, incident details, context, witnesses, actions taken\n4. Behavior Specialist generates:\n   - Professional, fact-based parent email (empathetic yet objective tone)\n   - Detailed incident report for records\n   - Suggested follow-up actions\n5. Teacher reviews, makes minor edits, sends\n6. This converts 45+ minutes of writing into 10 minutes of guided Q&A\n\n**Scenario 3: Student Homework Help (Middle School Student - Alpha Use Case)**\n\n**User Story**: \"As an 8th grade student stuck on my algebra homework, I want help understanding how to solve equations without just getting the answers, so that I can actually learn the concept and do well on the test.\"\n\n**User Journey**:\n1. Student loads Alpha agent (Student Support Agent)\n2. Alpha greets student: \"Hi! How do you like to learn?\" → Student picks \"Study Buddy\" personality\n3. Student types: \"I don't understand problem #5: solve 3x + 7 = 22\"\n4. Alpha recognizes homework request, redirects to teaching: \"Let me show you how to solve a SIMILAR problem: 2x + 5 = 13. Then you can try yours!\"\n5. Alpha walks through worked example in Study Buddy style (collaborative, encouraging)\n6. Alpha checks understanding: \"Now can you explain what we'd do first for YOUR problem?\"\n7. Student explains, Alpha confirms/corrects\n8. Alpha delegates to Artifact Generator → creates practice worksheet with 5 similar problems\n9. Student practices independently, gains confidence\n10. This teaches thinking process instead of just giving answers\n\n---\n\n## Technical Planning\n\n### 3-Dimensional Learning Data Structure\n\n**Critical Infrastructure for Standards Aligner Agent**\n\nTeachFlow uses a dual-index database structure to support both teacher-facing (standard code lookup) and student-facing (driving question lookup) workflows.\n\n**Storage Location**: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`\n\n**Directory Structure**:\n```\n/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/\n  ├── ngss-ms/\n  │   ├── life-science.json\n  │   ├── physical-science.json\n  │   └── earth-space-science.json\n  ├── common-core-ela-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  ├── common-core-math-ms/\n  │   └── grades-6-8.json\n  └── README.md (data structure documentation)\n```\n\n**JSON Schema** (dual-index for fast lookup):\n```json\n{\n  \"standard_set\": \"NGSS Middle School\",\n  \"subject\": \"Life Science\",\n  \"lookup_indexes\": {\n    \"by_standard_code\": {\n      \"MS-LS1-6\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    },\n    \"by_driving_question\": {\n      \"how do plants get energy\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\",\n      \"how do plants get the energy they need\": \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"lessons\": {\n    \"lesson_photosynthesis_001\": {\n      \"standard_code\": \"MS-LS1-6\",\n      \"standard_text\": \"Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for the role of photosynthesis in the cycling of matter and flow of energy into and out of organisms.\",\n      \"driving_question\": \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\",\n      \"grade_level\": 7,\n      \"three_dimensions\": {\n        \"sep\": {\n          \"code\": \"SEP-6\",\n          \"name\": \"Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions\",\n          \"student_actions\": \"Students construct explanations using evidence about how photosynthesis transforms light energy into chemical energy\"\n        },\n        \"dci\": {\n          \"code\": \"LS1.C\",\n          \"name\": \"Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms\",\n          \"core_idea\": \"Plants, algae, and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process called photosynthesis\"\n        },\n        \"ccc\": {\n          \"code\": \"CCC-5\",\n          \"name\": \"Energy and Matter\",\n          \"connection\": \"Within a natural system, the transfer of energy drives the motion and/or cycling of matter.

Data needs to be structured in this format.\n\n**Normalization Strategy for Driving Questions**:\n- Lowercase all text\n- Remove punctuation\n- Stem to core question (e.g., \"How do plants get energy?\" and \"How do plants get the energy they need?\" both map to same lesson)\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n**Storage Needs** (all local, no cloud):\n- **3D Standards Database**: NGSS (priority), Common Core ELA/Math, state standards (structured as above)\n- **Templates**: Lesson plan templates, assessment formats, communication templates, study guide formats\n- **Student Profiles** (on-demand): Anonymous learning profiles created as needed for differentiation, goal tracking\n- **Usage Analytics**: Workflow usage patterns, agent delegation frequency (for optimization)\n\n**Data Sources**:\n- NGSS standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- Common Core standards (user-provided, needs JSON structuring)\n- User-created templates and customizations\n- Session data for Goal Tracker and progress monitoring\n- **No PII storage** (all data local only)\n\n### Integration Points\n\n**Internal BMAD Modules**:\n- Potentially integrate with other education-focused BMAD modules (if developed)\n- Share template library across education modules\n\n**External Tools/Platforms** (future):\n- **LMS Integration**: Export lesson plans to Canvas, Google Classroom,

MVP\n- Optional: Web search for Resource Curator\n- Optional: Standards database APIs (alternative to local storage)\n\n### Technical Complexity Assessment\n\n**Complexity Level: Standard → Moderate** (elevated due to 3D Learning integration)\n\n**Moderate Complexity Elements**:\n- Agent delegation system (core agents → supporting agents)\n- Multi-personality mode for Alpha (3 distinct interaction styles)\n- Template-based document generation across multiple formats\n- **3D Learning data structure** (dual-index, normalization, scope provision)\n- **Standards Aligner intelligence** (driving question matching, 3D component provision)\n\n**Low Complexity Elements**:\n- Individual agent personalities (well-defined roles)\n- Interview-style workflows (guided Q&A)\n- Static template rendering\n\n**High Complexity Elements**:\n- **Alpha agent**: Student-facing with safety requirements, academic integrity detection, emotional intelligence, **3D-scoped teaching precision**\n- **Standards Aligner**: Comprehensive standards database, driving question normalization, 3D component correlation\n\n**Mitigation Strategies**:\n- Phased development: Build Standards Aligner in Phase 1 (before dependent agents)\n- Template-first approach: Build robust templates before complex generation logic\n- Alpha developed in later phase after Standards Aligner proven\n- User provides standards data (reduces data collection complexity)\n- Start with NGSS middle school only (narrower scope for MVP)\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n### Module Success Criteria\n\nHow we'll know the

Let me show you why that's a common mix-up...\"\n- **Progress Celebrations**: Goal Tracker sends encouraging messages when milestones hit\n\n**Delightful Surprises:**\n- First-time Alpha users get a friendly welcome explaining the three personality options with kid-friendly examples\n- Lesson plans include a \"Teacher Tip\" section with practical classroom wisdom\n- Behavior reports include a \"Positive Context\" section highlighting student strengths\n\n### Module Lore and Theming\n\n**\"The TeachFlow Professional Team\" Theme:**\n\nEach agent has a subtle backstory that emerges through their communication style:\n\n- **Instructional Designer**: The pedagogical expert who genuinely loves learning theory and gets excited about well-designed activities\n- **Behavior Specialist**: The calm, experienced professional who's \"seen it all\" but never loses empathy\n- **Professional Writer**: The detail-oriented communicator who takes pride in clear, precise language\n- **Data Analyst**: The evidence enthusiast who finds stories in numbers\n- **Alpha**: The enthusiastic tutor who remembers what it was like to be a middle schooler struggling with homework\n\n**Consistent Universe:**\n- All agents reference the \"3D Framework\" with reverence - it's the gold standard\n- Agents occasionally mention \"our Standards Aligner\" as the wise reference they all consult\n- The tone is professional but warm - like a great teaching team in a staff lounge\n\n**Visual Identity** (if icons/avatars used):\n- Each agent has a distinct color and symbol\n- 3D Learning components (SEP, DCI, CCC) have consistent visual markers\n- Driving questions appear in a distinct format\n\n---\n\n## Risk Assessment\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Standards Aligner Becomes Bottleneck**\n- **Risk**: Both Instructional Designer and Alpha depend critically on Standards Aligner. If it fails or has bugs, entire system is impacted.\n- **Impact**: Complete module failure for 3D-dependent workflows\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build and test Standards Aligner thoroughly in Phase 1\n  - Implement graceful degradation (manual standard lookup if agent fails)\n  - Comprehensive test suite for driving question matching\n  - Fallback to standard code lookup if driving question fails\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Driving Question Normalization Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Students phrase driving questions in many ways. Normalization might miss matches.\n- **Impact**: Alpha can't identify correct lesson, provides generic help instead of 3D-scoped\n- **Probability**: Medium-High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build comprehensive synonym mapping\n  - Allow fuzzy matching with confirmation (\"Did you mean...?\")\n  - Fallback to topic-based lookup\n  - Learn from mismatches and expand synonym database\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Standards Data Completeness**\n- **Risk**: Not all NGSS standards have clear driving questions or complete 3D mapping\n- **Impact**: Gaps in Standards Aligner knowledge\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Start with most common middle school standards\n  - Document gaps clearly\n  - Allow manual entry of missing standards\n  - Iteratively expand coverage based on teacher usage\n\n**🟢 LOW: Performance at Scale**\n- **Risk**: Large standards database might slow lookups\n- **Impact**: Slower than target <1 second response\n- **Probability**: Low (local JSON lookups are fast)\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Optimize JSON structure for fast lookup\n  - Consider indexing if needed\n  - Cache frequently accessed standards\n\n### Usability Risks\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Alpha Safety - Academic Integrity**\n- **Risk**: Alpha might accidentally provide direct homework answers despite safeguards\n- **Impact**: Students misuse for cheating, undermines educational value\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Extensive testing with real homework scenarios\n  - Clear \"worked example of SIMILAR problem\" pattern\n  - Teacher review mode to audit Alpha interactions\n  - Continuous monitoring and refinement of safety rules\n  - **QA/Validation Agent** to automatically check Alpha outputs for academic integrity\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: 3D Learning Concept Complexity**\n- **Risk**: Teachers unfamiliar with NGSS 3D framework might find system confusing\n- **Impact**: Lower adoption, perception of \"too complex\"\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear onboarding explaining 3D framework benefits\n  - `/why-3d` command for in-context help\n  - Templates that make 3D components obvious without requiring deep understanding\n  - Gradual introduction of 3D concepts\n\n**🟢 LOW: Student Confusion with Multiple Personalities**\n- **Risk**: Students might not understand Alpha's personality options\n- **Impact**: Poor personality selection, suboptimal learning experience\n- **Probability**: Low\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Kid-friendly explanations of each personality\n  - Allow switching mid-session\n  - Default to \"Study Buddy\" if student unsure\n  - Show examples of each personality style\n\n### Scope Risks\n\n**🔴 HIGH: Alpha Complexity Underestimated**\n- **Risk**: Alpha is most complex agent (3 personalities + 3D scoping + safety). Development might take 2x estimated time.\n- **Impact**: Timeline delays, Phase 4 extends significantly\n- **Probability**: High\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Build Alpha in Phase 4 after all patterns proven\n  - Start with single personality (Expert Tutor), add others later\n  - MVP: 3D scoping only, add safety features iteratively\n  - Accept that Alpha might be v2.0 feature if too complex\n\n**🟡 MEDIUM: Feature Creep from Supporting Agents**\n- **Risk**: Supporting agents (Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, etc.) could balloon in scope\n- **Impact**: Timeline expansion, never-ending Phase 3\n- **Probability**: Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Define MVP for each supporting agent\n  - Start with simple delegation patterns\n  - Enhance based on usage patterns, not speculation\n  - Accept that v1.0 supporting agents are basic\n\n**🟢 LOW: Standards Coverage Expansion Pressure**\n- **Risk**: Users request support for high school, elementary, all subjects immediately\n- **Impact**: Scope expansion beyond middle school NGSS science\n- **Probability**: Low-Medium\n- **Mitigation**:\n  - Clear communication: MVP is middle school NGSS science\n  - Document expansion path for future\n  - Modular data structure makes expansion easier later\n  - Resist feature requests outside core scope\n\n### Mitigation Strategies Summary\n\n**Critical Path Protection:**\n1. Build Standards Aligner first and validate thoroughly\n2. Test 3D integration with Instructional Designer before Alpha\n3. Build supporting agents as simple MVPs, enhance later\n4. **Implement QA/Validation Agent** for automated quality checking\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n1. No agent/workflow moves to next phase without testing\n2. **QA Agent validates all outputs** before marking complete\n3. Alpha requires external safety review before release\n4. 3D lesson quality verified by external educator review\n\n**Scope Management:**\n1. MVP: Middle school NGSS science only\n2. \"No\" to features outside roadmap until Phase 5\n3. Document requested features for v2.0\n\n**Communication:**\n1. Clear documentation of what's in scope vs future\n2. Transparent about 3D framework learning curve\n3. Regular user feedback loops\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Priority Order\n\n1. **Phase 1 MUST complete before anything else**: 3D Standards Database + Standards Aligner agent are architectural foundation\n2. **Validate 3D integration with Instructional Designer before building Alpha**: Prove the pattern works with simpler agent first\n3. **QA/Validation Agent in Phase 2**: Establish quality gates early to catch issues during development, not after\n\n### Key Design Decisions\n\n**3-Dimensional Learning as Core Architecture:**\n- Decision: Make NGSS 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC) a first-class citizen in data structure and agent logic\n- Rationale: Differentiates TeachFlow from generic lesson planners; ensures pedagogical soundness\n- Impact: Standards Aligner becomes critical infrastructure; all lesson planning flows through 3D framework\n\n**Driving Question as Primary Student Entry Point:**\n- Decision: Use lesson driving questions (not topics) for Alpha to identify lesson scope\n- Rationale: Students remember driving questions better than generic topics; maps precisely to standards\n- Impact: Requires dual-index database; better lesson scoping for student support\n\n**Alpha as Separate Core Agent (not workflow):**\n- Decision: Make student support a full agent with personality, not just a workflow\n- Rationale: Complexity (3 personalities, safety, 3D scoping) warrants agent-level design\n- Impact: Higher development effort but much better student experience\n\n**Local-Only Data Storage:**\n- Decision: All data (standards, profiles, templates) stored locally, no cloud\n- Rationale: Privacy, teacher control, no PII concerns, works offline\n- Impact: Simpler architecture, no backend infrastructure needed\n\n**QA/Validation Agent as Quality Gatekeeper:**\n- Decision: Dedicated agent for quality assurance rather than manual testing\n- Rationale: Automated validation catches issues faster; establishes consistent quality standards\n- Impact: Higher confidence in outputs; reduces manual testing burden\n\n### Open Questions\n\n**Standards Data Collection:**\n- Q: Will user (Frank) provide NGSS data in structured format or raw documents?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 1 Week 1\n- Impact: Data structuring effort estimate\n\n**Alpha Personality Implementation:**\n- Q: Should personalities be separate prompt templates or dynamic prompt engineering?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 4 planning\n- Impact: Complexity and maintainability trade-off\n\n**QA Agent Automation Level:**\n- Q: What percentage of validation can be automated vs requiring human review?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 2 during QA Agent development\n- Impact: Teacher effort for validation\n\n**Standards Coverage Scope:**\n- Q: Focus only on most common standards for MVP, or attempt comprehensive coverage?\n- Resolution needed: Phase 1 during database creation\n- Impact: Development timeline and initial usefulness\n\n---\n\n## Resources and References\n\n### Inspiration Sources\n\n**NGSS Framework:**\n- Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) official documentation\n- 3-Dimensional Learning research and best practices\n- NGSS Appendix F: Science and Engineering Practices\n- NGSS Appendix G: Crosscutting Concepts\n\n**Pedagogical Research:**\n- Understanding by Design (backward design framework)\n- Culturally Responsive Teaching practices\n- Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles\n- Growth mindset research (Carol Dweck)\n\n**AI Tutoring Research:**\n- Socratic questioning techniques for learning\n- Adaptive learning personality systems\n- Academic integrity in AI tutoring\n- Middle school developmental psychology\n\n### Similar Modules\n\n**Within BMAD:**\n- BMM (BMAD Method Manager) - Module structure patterns\n- CIS (Claude Instruction Studio) - Agent design patterns\n\n**External Tools** (for competitive analysis):\n- Generic lesson planner tools (lack 3D integration)\n- AI homework helpers (lack lesson scoping)\n- Standards alignment tools (lack workflow automation)\n\n**Key Differentiators:**\n- TeachFlow integrates 3D learning at architecture level\n- Driving question-based student support scoping\n- Complete teaching workflow coverage (instruction + behavior + data)\n\n### Technical References\n\n**BMAD Framework:**\n- BMAD agent creation patterns\n- BMAD workflow execution engine\n- BMAD delegation system\n- BMAD template system\n\n**Data Formats:**\n- JSON for standards database (dual-index structure)\n- Markdown for templates\n- YAML for agent/workflow configuration\n\n**Educational Standards:**\n- NGSS middle school standards documentation\n- Common Core State Standards (ELA & Math)\n- State-specific standards frameworks\n\n---\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A. 3-Dimensional Learning Framework Reference\n\n**What is 3-Dimensional Learning?**\n\nNGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) organizes science education around three dimensions that must work together in every lesson:\n\n**Dimension 1: Science & Engineering Practices (SEP)**\n*What students DO - the skills and processes*\n\n8 Practices:\n1. Asking Questions and Defining Problems\n2. Developing and Using Models\n3. Planning and Carrying Out Investigations\n4. Analyzing and Interpreting Data\n5. Using Mathematics and Computational Thinking\n6. **Constructing Explanations and Designing Solutions** (most common in lessons)\n7. Engaging in Argument from Evidence\n8. Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information\n\n**Dimension 2: Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI)**\n*What students LEARN - the core concepts*\n\nOrganized by domain:\n- **Life Science (LS)**: LS1 (structures/processes), LS2 (ecosystems), LS3 (heredity), LS4 (evolution)\n- **Physical Science (PS)**: PS1 (matter), PS2 (motion/forces), PS3 (energy), PS4 (waves)\n- **Earth/Space Science (ESS)**: ESS1 (Earth's place), ESS2 (Earth's systems), ESS3 (human impacts)\n\n**Dimension 3: Crosscutting Concepts (CCC)**\n*HOW students THINK - the thinking patterns*\n\n7 Concepts:\n1. Patterns\n2. Cause and Effect\n3. Scale, Proportion, and Quantity\n4. Systems and System Models\n5. **Energy and Matter** (very common in science lessons)\n6. Structure and Function\n7. Stability and Change\n\n**Why All Three Dimensions Matter:**\n\nTraditional teaching: \"Learn about photosynthesis\" (DCI only)\n3D Learning: \"Construct an explanation (SEP) for how plants transform energy (DCI) by tracking matter and energy flow (CCC)\"\n\nThe three dimensions create deeper, more transferable learning.\n\n**Example Lesson with 3D Integration:**\n\n**Standard**: MS-LS1-6 (Photosynthesis)\n**Driving Question**: \"How do plants get the energy they need to live and grow?\"\n\n**SEP (Constructing Explanations)**:\n- Students build explanations using evidence\n- Not just: \"What is photosynthesis?\" (recall)\n- But: \"Using evidence, explain HOW plants get energy from light\"\n\n**DCI (LS1.C - Organization for Matter and Energy Flow)**:\n- Core idea: Plants use light energy to make sugars from CO2 and H2O\n- Depth boundary: Energy transformation (include), molecular mechanisms (exclude for grade 7)\n\n**CCC (Energy and Matter)**:\n- Thinking pattern: Track where energy goes at each step\n- Questions: \"Where does the light energy end up?\" \"What happens to the CO2 and H2O?\"\n- Connects to other phenomena using same thinking pattern\n\n**How TeachFlow Uses 3D Learning:**\n\n1. **Standards Aligner** stores complete 3D mapping for each standard\n2. **Instructional Designer** builds lessons that engage all three dimensions\n3. **Alpha** teaches within the 3D scope - right SEP skill, right DCI depth, right CCC thinking\n4. **QA/Validation Agent** verifies all three dimensions are present and integrated\n\n### B. Detailed Agent Specifications\n\n**See Agent Architecture section for complete specifications of all 11 agents (5 core + 6 supporting)**\n\nKey agent capabilities summary:\n- **Core Agents**: Instructional Designer, Behavior Specialist, Professional Writer, Data Analyst, Alpha\n- **Critical Infrastructure**: Standards Aligner (3D intelligence hub)\n- **Supporting Specialists**: Resource Curator, Accommodation Specialist, Artifact Generator, Goal Tracker, QA/Validation Agent\n\n### C. Workflow Detailed Designs\n\n**See Workflow Ecosystem section for complete workflow specifications**\n\nWorkflow categories:\n- **Core** (3): Lesson Plan Builder, Behavior Incident Report, Progress Report Generator\n- **Feature** (5): Assessment Creation, Differentiation Strategies, Student Goal Setting, Classroom Management Plans, Parent Communication Templates\n- **Utility** (1): Student Support Session (Alpha-specific)\n\n### D. Data Structures and Schemas\n\n**Primary Data Structure: 3D Standards Database**\n\n**See Technical Planning section for:**\n- Complete JSON schema with dual-index structure\n- Directory organization\n- Normalization strategies\n- Example photosynthesis lesson data\n\n**Key Data Files:**\n- `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/ngss-ms/*.json` - NGSS middle school standards with 3D components\n- `/bmad/teachflow/templates/*.md` - Document templates\n- `/bmad/teachflow/data/profiles/*.json` - Student profiles (created on-demand)\n\n### E.
