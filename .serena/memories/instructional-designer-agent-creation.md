# Instructional Designer Agent Creation - Session Summary

## Date
2025-10-16

## Objective
Create and install the "Instructional Designer" (Mommy) agent for the TeachFlow module following the proper BMAD agent creation workflow.

## Context
This session followed the creation of the Atlas agent. User wanted to continue creating additional TeachFlow agents, specifically an Instructional Designer agent to complement Atlas's standards alignment capabilities.

## Critical Discovery: Installer Overwriting User Modifications

### Problem Identified
The BMAD installer was overwriting customized workflow files (specifically `instructions.md`) during update operations, destroying user modifications like the Step 10b automation we had added to the agent creation workflow.

**Root Cause:**
- File: `/home/sallvain/dev/tools/BMAD-METHOD/tools/cli/installers/lib/core/installer.js`
- Function: `copyDirectoryWithFiltering()` (lines 903-936)
- Issue: Used `{ overwrite: true }` when copying files, destroying user customizations
- Pattern: Only protected `config.yaml` files from overwriting

### Solution Implemented
Modified installer.js to skip workflow instructions.md files (lines 913-916):
```javascript
// Skip workflow instructions.md files to preserve user customizations
if (file.includes('workflows/') && file.endsWith('instructions.md')) {
  continue;
}
```

**Impact:**
- Step 10b automation (added in previous session) is now protected from installer updates
- Future workflow customizations will be preserved during updates
- Follows existing pattern for `config.yaml` protection

## Agent Creation Process

### Workflow Execution
Used `/bmad:bmb:workflows:create-agent` workflow following EXACT checkpoint pattern:
- Step-by-step execution with "Continue [c] or Edit [e]?" prompts
- Used proper `‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ` separator lines
- Maintained conversational workflow voice throughout

### Agent Specifications

**Basic Info:**
- Type: Module Agent (teachflow)
- Name: "Mommy"
- Title: "Expert Instructional Designer"
- Icon: üìö

**Persona:**
- Role: Expert Instructional Designer + 3D Learning Specialist
- Identity: 10+ years experience, standards-aligned curriculum expert, 3D learning frameworks specialist
- Communication: Professional yet warm and supportive, patient educator
- Principles: Every lesson engages all 3 dimensions (SEP, DCI, CCC), design with all learners in mind

**Capabilities (Menu Items):**
1. *lesson-plan ‚Üí lesson-plan-builder workflow
2. *assessment ‚Üí assessment-creation workflow
3. *differentiate ‚Üí differentiation-strategies workflow
4. *goals ‚Üí student-goal-setting workflow
5. *help ‚Üí show menu
6. *exit ‚Üí exit with confirmation

**Critical Actions:**
- Load config.yaml and set variables
- Remember user name: {user_name}
- ALWAYS communicate in {communication_language}
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS delegate to Atlas agent FIRST for 3D standards alignment
- Remember 3D learning = SEP + DCI + CCC integration

**Note:** Removed "unit-plan" capability at user's request (user doesn't create unit plans, only lesson plans)

## Installation Process

### Files Created/Modified

1. **Source Agent YAML:**
   - Path: `bmad/teachflow/agents/instructional-designer.agent.yaml`
   - Status: Created (2.9KB)

2. **Compiled Agent MD:**
   - Path: `bmad/teachflow/agents/instructional-designer.md`
   - Status: Compiled successfully (5.4KB)
   - Method: Manual compilation script (since workflow was overwritten and build CLI didn't detect new agent)

3. **Customization Template:**
   - Path: `bmad/_cfg/agents/teachflow-instructional-designer.customize.yaml`
   - Status: Created (empty template for future customizations)

4. **Manifest Update:**
   - Path: `bmad/_cfg/agent-manifest.csv`
   - Status: Added line 20 with full agent details
   - Total agents: 20 (was 19)

5. **BMAD-METHOD Source:**
   - Path: `/home/sallvain/dev/tools/BMAD-METHOD/src/modules/teachflow/agents/instructional-designer.agent.yaml`
   - Status: Already copied (2.9KB)
   - Ready for distribution in future installer releases

### Compilation Details

**Challenge:** 
- Build CLI didn't detect new agent after creation
- Installer update failed due to .serena module not found in source

**Solution:**
Created temporary compilation script using XmlHandler directly:
```javascript
const xmlHandler = new XmlHandler();
const xmlContent = await xmlHandler.buildFromYaml(
  yamlPath,
  customizeExists ? customizePath : null,
  { includeMetadata: true }
);
await fs.writeFile(mdPath, xmlContent, 'utf8');
```

**Result:** Successfully compiled YAML ‚Üí MD format with proper activation block and menu structure

## Key Learnings

### Workflow Adherence Critical
User strongly emphasized importance of following workflow.xml EXACTLY:
- Must show checkpoint separator: `‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ`
- Must ask: "Continue [c] or Edit [e]?" after EACH step
- Must WAIT for user response before proceeding
- Never summarize or skip ahead
- Pattern from workflow.xml lines 134-144 (substep 2c)

### Installer Protection Pattern
When installer needs to preserve user customizations:
1. Check file type/pattern (like `workflows/*/instructions.md`)
2. Add skip condition BEFORE the copy operation
3. Document reason in comment
4. Follow existing protection patterns (like `config.yaml`)

### Agent Compilation Path
When build CLI doesn't detect new agents:
1. Use XmlHandler directly for compilation
2. Ensure customize.yaml template exists (even if empty)
3. Write to correct .md path in module agents directory
4. Manually update manifest if needed

## Integration with TeachFlow Ecosystem

### Agent Coordination
**Instructional Designer (Mommy) ‚Üî Atlas:**
- Mommy MUST delegate to Atlas FIRST for standards alignment
- Atlas provides: SEP, DCI, CCC components + depth boundaries
- Mommy uses Atlas output to design pedagogically sound lessons
- Critical action ensures 3D learning integrity

### Workflow Integration
All Mommy's menu items point to TeachFlow workflows:
- `{project-root}/bmad/teachflow/workflows/lesson-plan-builder/workflow.yaml`
- `{project-root}/bmad/teachflow/workflows/assessment-creation/workflow.yaml`
- `{project-root}/bmad/teachflow/workflows/differentiation-strategies/workflow.yaml`
- `{project-root}/bmad/teachflow/workflows/student-goal-setting/workflow.yaml`

These workflows likely need to be created or exist already in the teachflow module.

## Session Outcome

‚úÖ **Successfully completed:**
1. Fixed installer to protect workflow customizations (installer.js:913-916)
