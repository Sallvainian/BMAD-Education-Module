# TeachFlow Standards Aligner Agent - Creation Session

**Date:** 2025-10-15
**Session Type:** Agent Creation via /bmad:bmb:workflows:create-agent
**Module:** TeachFlow (teachflow)
**Agent Created:** Standards Aligner (standards-aligner.agent.yaml)

## Session Summary

Successfully created the **Standards Aligner** agent - the critical infrastructure agent for TeachFlow's 3-Dimensional Learning system. This agent serves as the intelligence hub that provides NGSS standards data and 3D components (SEP, DCI, CCC) to other TeachFlow agents.

## Agent Specifications

**Agent Details:**
- **Name:** Standards Aligner
- **Title:** 3D Learning Intelligence Hub
- **Icon:** ðŸ“‹
- **Type:** Module Agent (teachflow)
- **Category:** Critical Infrastructure
- **File Location:** `/bmad/teachflow/agents/standards-aligner.agent.yaml`

**Core Purpose:**
- Maps standard codes â†’ complete 3D components (SEP, DCI, CCC)
- Maps driving questions â†’ lessons + 3D scope
- Provides single source of truth for standards alignment
- Enables 3D-informed lesson planning (Instructional Designer)
- Enables 3D-scoped student support (Alpha)

**Key Capabilities (11 Commands):**
1. `lookup-standard` - Standard code â†’ 3D components
2. `lookup-question` - Driving question â†’ lesson scope
3. `get-3d-components` - Extract SEP, DCI, CCC specifications
4. `validate-alignment` - Check 3D integration quality
5. `map-curriculum` - Traditional topics â†’ 3D standards
6. `search-standards` - Keyword/filter search
7. `list-driving-questions` - Browse by grade/domain
8. `explain-3d` - Educational context for teachers
9. `get-depth-boundaries` - Appropriate instructional depth
10. `status` - System health and coverage
11. Standard `help` and `exit` commands

## Persona Design

**Role:** 3-Dimensional Learning Intelligence Hub and Standards Alignment specialist

**Identity:** 
- Deep NGSS expertise with focus on 3D learning (SEP, DCI, CCC)
- Middle school science specialist (grades 6-8)
- Critical infrastructure serving Instructional Designer and Alpha agents
- Maintains comprehensive standards database with dual-index (codes + driving questions)

**Communication Style:**
- Precise and structured data delivery
- Methodical and reliable
- Provides complete 3D specifications with depth boundaries
- Infrastructure-focused (not user-facing)

**Principles:**
- Authentic 3D learning requires all three dimensions working together
- Infrastructure over decoration - every lookup enables precise implementation
- Single source of truth for consistency across TeachFlow
- Accuracy over speed, completeness over convenience
- Explicit depth boundaries prevent over/under-teaching

## Technical Architecture

**Data Sources:**
- Primary: NGSS middle school standards (Life/Physical/Earth-Space Science)
- Secondary: Common Core ELA and Math standards (grades 6-8)
- Location: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/`
- Format: JSON with dual-index structure

**Performance Targets:**
- Lookup speed: <1 second
- Accuracy: 99%+ for standard code and driving question matching
- Availability: 100% (local, no external dependencies)
- Coverage: Complete NGSS middle school (MS-*)

**Delegation Pattern:**
```
Instructional Designer â†’ Standards Aligner (standard code lookup)
Alpha â†’ Standards Aligner (driving question lookup)
```

## Development Context

**Module Brief Reference:** `/docs/module-brief-teachflow-2025-10-14.md`
- Comprehensive 1,294-line planning document
- Documents all 11 TeachFlow agents and 9 workflows
- Standards Aligner identified as Phase 1 critical infrastructure

**Development Phase:**
- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Standards Aligner + 3D standards database creation
- **Must complete before:** Instructional Designer (Phase 2) and Alpha (Phase 4)
- **Rationale:** All dependent agents require 3D component provision

**Next Phase Dependencies:**
- Phase 2: Instructional Designer needs Standards Aligner for lesson planning
- Phase 4: Alpha needs Standards Aligner for student support scoping

## Workflow Notes

**Creation Method:** YOLO mode (all steps from module brief)
- Step 0: Loaded technical documentation âœ…
- Step 1: Confirmed agent purpose and type (Module Agent) âœ…
- Step 2-6: Generated complete persona, capabilities, and YAML âœ…
- Step 9: Validated structure and completeness âœ…

**Quality Validation Results:**
- âœ… Valid YAML structure
- âœ… Complete persona (all 4 components in first-person)
- âœ… Required commands present (help, exit)
- âœ… Path variables used correctly
- âœ… Module integration configured
- âœ… Critical infrastructure markers documented

## Next Steps Required

1. **Create 3D Standards Database** (Phase 1 continuation)
   - Structure NGSS middle school data in dual-index JSON format
   - Location: `/bmad/teachflow/data/standards/ngss-ms/`
   - Required: life-science.json, physical-science.json, earth-space-science.json
   - User (Frank) will provide NGSS data

2. **Compile Agent to XML**
   - Run BMAD Method installer
   - Select "Compile Agents (Quick rebuild of all agent .md files)"
   - Output: `standards-aligner.md` (XML format)

3. **Test Standards Aligner**
   - Validate lookup accuracy with sample queries
   - Test driving question normalization
   - Verify 3D component completeness

4. **Phase 2: Build Instructional Designer**
   - Next agent in TeachFlow development
   - Will delegate to Standards Aligner for 3D components
   - Validates Standards Aligner integration pattern

## Key Learnings

**Agent Creation Pattern:**
- Module briefs provide complete agent specifications
- YOLO mode effective when all requirements documented
- Infrastructure agents need explicit dependency documentation
- Critical to document delegation patterns for dependent agents

**3D Learning Integration:**
- All three dimensions (SEP, DCI, CCC) must be provided together
- Depth boundaries prevent inappropriate instructional scope
- Dual-index enables both teacher and student workflows
- Driving question normalization critical for student-facing access

**TeachFlow Architecture:**
- Standards Aligner is single point of failure if unavailable
- Must prioritize reliability and accuracy over features
- Local data storage ensures privacy and offline operation
- Performance targets align with user experience needs
