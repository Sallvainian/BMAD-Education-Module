## Testing Checklist

After creating each component:

- [ ] Agent loads without errors
- [ ] Agent commands work as expected
- [ ] Workflow executes successfully
- [ ] Output matches expectations
- [ ] Delegation works correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation is complete
- [ ] Examples are clear and helpful

---

## Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Delegation Model**: Core agents can delegate to supporting agents, creating efficient workflows
- **Modular Design**: Each agent/workflow is independent, allowing incremental development
- **Template-First**: Workflows use templates for consistent, professional outputs
- **Interview Pattern**: Complex workflows use interview-style data collection for better UX

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with external data sources (grade books, LMS)
- Automated report scheduling
- Data visualization dashboard
- Mobile-friendly interfaces
- Multi-language support
- District policy customization

### Known Limitations
- Agents must be created manually using workflows
- No automated testing framework yet
- Templates need manual updates
- Limited data persistence between sessions
